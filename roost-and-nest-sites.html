<p>The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night.</p>

<p>Roost = A bird temporarily spending a night at a location but moving frequently</p>
<p>Potential nest = A bird returning to the same location through time (across multiple days and weeks)</p>

<p>If a birds night-time roost is does not change then the average roost spacing will be very low (&lt;0.5 km - green rows). We should also look at the data where the average roost spacing is &lt;1km (orange rows). All other rows are white:</p>
