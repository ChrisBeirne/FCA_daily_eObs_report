This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X6.Daule 0.0 2024-01-16 11:01 - 14:00 -80.25494 -2.359186 11 3.0 X6._11240116 X4.Guasmo 3.5 2024-01-16 05:30 - 10:30 -80.13551 -2.048368 15 5.0 X4._05240116 X6.Daule 6.5 2024-01-16 05:30 - 07:30 -80.41880 -2.532464 5 2.0 X6._05240116 X6.Daule 21.5 2024-01-15 14:40 - 16:30 -80.41762 -2.530709 6 1.8 X6._14240115 X4.Guasmo 20.5 2024-01-15 12:00 - 17:30 -80.13564 -2.048254 16 5.5 X4._12240115 X4.Guasmo 29.0 2024-01-15 05:30 - 09:00 -80.15665 -2.062271 8 3.5 X4._05240115 X6.Daule 30.0 2024-01-15 05:30 - 08:00 -80.36832 -2.473716 6 2.5 X6._05240115 X4.Guasmo 44.5 2024-01-14 14:10 - 17:30 -80.15664 -2.062269 9 3.3 X4._14240114 X6.Daule 44.5 2024-01-14 14:00 - 17:30 -80.36820 -2.473819 8 3.5 X6._14240114 X4.Guasmo 51.5 2024-01-14 05:30 - 10:30 -80.08385 -1.997789 11 5.0 X4._05240114 X6.Daule 55.0 2024-01-14 05:30 - 07:00 -80.36123 -2.462742 4 1.5 X6._05240114 X6.Daule 68.5 2024-01-13 11:50 - 17:30 -80.36126 -2.462848 14 5.7 X6._11240113 X2.Quil 76.0 2024-01-13 06:00 - 10:00 -80.64477 -1.760192 9 4.0 X2._06240113 X6.Daule 78.0 2024-01-13 05:30 - 08:00 -80.35854 -2.454689 6 2.5 X6._05240113 X3.Pigio 78.5 2024-01-13 05:30 - 07:30 -80.68715 -1.507416 5 2.0 X3._05240113 X2.Quil 92.5 2024-01-12 15:31 - 17:30 -80.64453 -1.760163 5 2.0 X2._15240112 X6.Daule 92.5 2024-01-12 14:30 - 17:30 -80.35757 -2.455297 7 3.0 X6._14240112 X2.Quil 100.5 2024-01-12 07:00 - 09:30 -80.17494 -2.060361 6 2.5 X2._07240112 X4.Guasmo 101.5 2024-01-12 05:30 - 08:30 -80.15436 -2.033113 7 3.0 X4._05240112 X6.Daule 102.0 2024-01-12 05:30 - 08:00 -80.36636 -2.469215 8 2.5 X6._05240112 X4.Guasmo 116.5 2024-01-11 16:00 - 17:30 -80.15422 -2.032854 4 1.5 X4._16240111 X2.Quil 116.5 2024-01-11 14:50 - 17:30 -80.17769 -2.060587 9 2.7 X2._14240111 X6.Daule 116.5 2024-01-11 12:00 - 17:30 -80.36619 -2.469223 14 5.5 X6._12240111 X3.Pigio 122.5 2024-01-11 10:00 - 11:30 -80.68916 -1.549376 4 1.5 X3._10240111 X4.Guasmo 123.5 2024-01-11 08:30 - 10:30 -80.09208 -1.994216 5 2.0 X4._08240111 X2.Quil 122.0 2024-01-11 05:31 - 12:00 -80.31445 -2.014356 15 6.5 X2._05240111 X3.Pigio 126.0 2024-01-11 05:30 - 08:00 -80.68914 -1.548608 6 2.5 X3._05240111 X6.Daule 123.5 2024-01-11 05:30 - 10:30 -80.27640 -2.431883 13 5.0 X6._05240111 X4.Guasmo 126.0 2024-01-11 05:30 - 08:00 -80.09243 -1.993072 6 2.5 X4._05240111 X4.Guasmo 141.0 2024-01-10 15:30 - 17:00 -80.09167 -1.994439 4 1.5 X4._15240110 X6.Daule 140.5 2024-01-10 15:20 - 17:30 -80.27645 -2.431992 7 2.2 X6._15240110 X6.Daule 143.0 2024-01-10 13:40 - 15:00 -80.27209 -2.430806 5 1.3 X6._13240110 X4.Guasmo 143.0 2024-01-10 13:30 - 15:00 -80.09326 -1.996471 6 1.5 X4._13240110 X3.Pigio 140.5 2024-01-10 12:01 - 17:30 -80.68869 -1.547929 12 5.5 X3._12240110 X2.Quil 140.5 2024-01-10 11:30 - 17:30 -80.31445 -2.014331 19 6.0 X2._11240110 X6.Daule 146.5 2024-01-10 10:00 - 11:30 -80.27154 -2.400681 4 1.5 X6._10240110 X4.Guasmo 148.3 2024-01-10 06:30 - 09:40 -80.09669 -2.008443 9 3.2 X4._06240110 X6.Daule 150.0 2024-01-10 05:30 - 08:00 -80.28987 -2.424812 6 2.5 X6._05240110 X2.Quil 149.5 2024-01-10 05:30 - 08:30 -80.36295 -2.033637 7 3.0 X2._05240110 X3.Pigio 146.5 2024-01-10 05:30 - 11:30 -80.68927 -1.548925 13 6.0 X3._05240110 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
