This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 13.5 2024-02-26 14:00 - 16:30 -80.80693 -1.647070 6 2.5 X3._14240226 X6.Daule 16.5 2024-02-26 11:10 - 13:30 -80.54957 -2.104592 7 2.3 X6._11240226 X3.Pigio 20.5 2024-02-26 06:00 - 09:30 -80.80350 -1.638905 8 3.5 X3._06240226 X6.Daule 21.5 2024-02-26 06:00 - 08:30 -80.49699 -2.077846 6 2.5 X6._06240226 X3.Pigio 36.5 2024-02-25 15:00 - 17:30 -80.80331 -1.638745 6 2.5 X3._15240225 X3.Pigio 39.2 2024-02-25 12:30 - 14:50 -80.80385 -1.640311 7 2.3 X3._12240225 X4.Guasmo 39.5 2024-02-25 12:00 - 14:30 -80.25466 -2.009713 6 2.5 X4._12240225 X4.Guasmo 44.0 2024-02-25 08:20 - 10:00 -80.26515 -2.008984 6 1.7 X4._08240225 X3.Pigio 45.0 2024-02-25 06:00 - 09:00 -80.77118 -1.641164 7 3.0 X3._06240225 X6.Daule 43.5 2024-02-25 06:00 - 10:30 -80.45415 -2.076392 10 4.5 X6._06240225 X4.Guasmo 46.5 2024-02-25 06:00 - 07:30 -80.26637 -2.011521 4 1.5 X4._06240225 X6.Daule 60.5 2024-02-24 16:10 - 17:30 -80.45413 -2.076629 6 1.3 X6._16240224 X3.Pigio 60.5 2024-02-24 12:20 - 17:30 -80.77108 -1.640579 14 5.2 X3._12240224 X3.Pigio 68.5 2024-02-24 06:00 - 09:30 -80.79734 -1.675310 8 3.5 X3._06240224 X4.Guasmo 68.0 2024-02-24 06:00 - 10:01 -80.25451 -2.009553 11 4.0 X4._06240224 X3.Pigio 84.5 2024-02-23 15:30 - 17:30 -80.79631 -1.677272 5 2.0 X3._15240223 X2.Quil 85.0 2024-02-23 14:40 - 17:00 -80.56314 -2.040785 7 2.3 X2._14240223 X4.Guasmo 84.5 2024-02-23 14:20 - 17:30 -80.25446 -2.009627 13 3.2 X4._14240223 X3.Pigio 87.0 2024-02-23 13:10 - 15:00 -80.79597 -1.678173 8 1.8 X3._13240223 X2.Quil 89.0 2024-02-23 09:30 - 13:00 -80.56808 -2.039738 8 3.5 X2._09240223 X4.Guasmo 90.0 2024-02-23 06:00 - 12:00 -80.17352 -2.018174 18 6.0 X4._06240223 X6.Daule 94.0 2024-02-23 06:00 - 08:00 -80.33882 -2.443839 5 2.0 X6._06240223 X2.Quil 94.5 2024-02-23 06:00 - 07:30 -80.57196 -2.045693 4 1.5 X2._06240223 X6.Daule 109.5 2024-02-22 14:50 - 16:30 -80.34021 -2.443476 6 1.7 X6._14240222 X2.Quil 108.5 2024-02-22 14:30 - 17:30 -80.57072 -2.044561 7 3.0 X2._14240222 X4.Guasmo 110.0 2024-02-22 12:30 - 16:00 -80.17310 -2.016949 8 3.5 X4._12240222 X6.Daule 113.5 2024-02-22 10:40 - 12:30 -80.35043 -2.457222 6 1.8 X6._10240222 X4.Guasmo 114.0 2024-02-22 10:10 - 12:00 -80.17372 -2.017830 7 1.8 X4._10240222 X3.Pigio 111.5 2024-02-22 09:10 - 14:30 -80.80861 -1.643872 21 5.3 X3._09240222 X2.Quil 112.0 2024-02-22 06:30 - 14:00 -80.57168 -2.044519 20 7.5 X2._06240222 X3.Pigio 118.0 2024-02-22 06:00 - 08:00 -80.80856 -1.636059 5 2.0 X3._06240222 X6.Daule 117.5 2024-02-22 06:00 - 08:30 -80.30367 -2.501407 8 2.5 X6._06240222 X3.Pigio 132.5 2024-02-21 16:10 - 17:30 -80.80793 -1.634773 5 1.3 X3._16240221 X4.Guasmo 133.0 2024-02-21 15:30 - 17:00 -80.16761 -2.082783 4 1.5 X4._15240221 X2.Quil 133.2 2024-02-21 15:10 - 16:50 -80.57157 -2.044255 7 1.7 X2._15240221 X4.Guasmo 136.0 2024-02-21 12:40 - 14:00 -80.16589 -2.083328 8 1.3 X4._12240221 X6.Daule 132.5 2024-02-21 11:40 - 17:30 -80.30360 -2.501308 14 5.8 X6._11240221 X1.Guayas 132.5 2024-02-21 11:00 - 17:30 -79.99789 -2.141139 16 6.5 X1._11240221 X3.Pigio 140.0 2024-02-21 06:30 - 10:00 -80.79157 -1.650431 10 3.5 X3._06240221 X6.Daule 140.5 2024-02-21 06:30 - 09:30 -80.23179 -2.426139 7 3.0 X6._06240221 X1.Guayas 140.0 2024-02-21 06:00 - 10:00 -80.00337 -2.138434 9 4.0 X1._06240221 X4.Guasmo 141.0 2024-02-21 06:00 - 09:00 -80.14888 -2.076209 7 3.0 X4._06240221 X4.Guasmo 156.5 2024-02-20 16:00 - 17:30 -80.14914 -2.075926 4 1.5 X4._16240220 X1.Guayas 156.5 2024-02-20 16:00 - 17:30 -80.00358 -2.139130 4 1.5 X1._16240220 X6.Daule 156.5 2024-02-20 15:30 - 17:30 -80.23095 -2.426017 7 2.0 X6._15240220 X2.Quil 157.0 2024-02-20 14:10 - 17:00 -80.44587 -1.955644 8 2.8 X2._14240220 X4.Guasmo 159.5 2024-02-20 13:00 - 14:30 -80.14688 -2.067330 4 1.5 X4._13240220 X3.Pigio 156.5 2024-02-20 13:00 - 17:30 -80.79277 -1.651170 10 4.5 X3._13240220 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
