This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X6.Daule 12.5 2024-03-02 13:00 - 17:30 -80.50516 -2.359995 10 4.5 X6._13240302 X6.Daule 17.5 2024-03-02 11:00 - 12:30 -80.50228 -2.360225 8 1.5 X6._11240302 X6.Daule 20.5 2024-03-02 06:00 - 09:30 -80.35367 -2.284000 8 3.5 X6._06240302 X6.Daule 38.0 2024-03-01 14:30 - 16:00 -80.35537 -2.284200 6 1.5 X6._14240301 X4.Guasmo 38.5 2024-03-01 14:00 - 15:30 -80.18806 -2.008130 4 1.5 X4._14240301 X6.Daule 42.5 2024-03-01 05:30 - 11:30 -80.28472 -2.257151 12 6.0 X6._05240301 X4.Guasmo 41.5 2024-03-01 05:30 - 12:30 -80.18868 -2.003036 15 7.0 X4._05240301 X3.Pigio 41.5 2024-03-01 05:30 - 12:30 -80.13801 -2.126219 15 7.0 X3._05240301 X6.Daule 60.5 2024-02-29 15:30 - 17:30 -80.28495 -2.257238 7 2.0 X6._15240229 X3.Pigio 60.5 2024-02-29 14:30 - 17:30 -80.13790 -2.125889 7 3.0 X3._14240229 X4.Guasmo 60.5 2024-02-29 14:00 - 17:30 -80.18813 -2.003075 9 3.5 X4._14240229 X3.Pigio 69.0 2024-02-29 06:00 - 09:00 -80.60306 -2.343721 7 3.0 X3._06240229 X6.Daule 68.0 2024-02-29 06:00 - 10:00 -80.52825 -2.131396 9 4.0 X6._06240229 X4.Guasmo 70.0 2024-02-29 05:30 - 08:00 -80.17030 -2.020238 6 2.5 X4._05240229 X4.Guasmo 84.5 2024-02-28 15:00 - 17:30 -80.17032 -2.020262 6 2.5 X4._15240228 X3.Pigio 84.5 2024-02-28 14:30 - 17:30 -80.60234 -2.343357 7 3.0 X3._14240228 X6.Daule 84.5 2024-02-28 14:20 - 17:30 -80.52820 -2.131097 9 3.2 X6._14240228 X6.Daule 88.0 2024-02-28 09:30 - 14:00 -80.54941 -2.120780 10 4.5 X6._09240228 X4.Guasmo 88.5 2024-02-28 09:30 - 13:30 -80.17273 -2.016966 9 4.0 X4._09240228 X3.Pigio 94.0 2024-02-28 06:00 - 08:00 -80.63334 -1.913796 5 2.0 X3._06240228 X4.Guasmo 93.0 2024-02-28 06:00 - 09:00 -80.17383 -2.017884 7 3.0 X4._06240228 X6.Daule 93.5 2024-02-28 06:00 - 08:30 -80.54702 -2.119363 6 2.5 X6._06240228 X4.Guasmo 108.5 2024-02-27 15:30 - 17:30 -80.17355 -2.018056 7 2.0 X4._15240227 X3.Pigio 108.5 2024-02-27 14:30 - 17:30 -80.63316 -1.913476 7 3.0 X3._14240227 X4.Guasmo 112.0 2024-02-27 10:50 - 14:00 -80.17414 -2.017683 9 3.2 X4._10240227 X3.Pigio 116.5 2024-02-27 06:30 - 09:30 -80.80461 -1.648860 7 3.0 X3._06240227 X6.Daule 108.5 2024-02-27 06:00 - 17:30 -80.54716 -2.119545 26 11.5 X6._06240227 X4.Guasmo 117.5 2024-02-27 06:00 - 08:30 -80.20668 -2.012930 6 2.5 X4._06240227 X6.Daule 133.5 2024-02-26 14:30 - 16:30 -80.54828 -2.117129 7 2.0 X6._14240226 X3.Pigio 133.5 2024-02-26 14:00 - 16:30 -80.80693 -1.647070 6 2.5 X3._14240226 X4.Guasmo 132.5 2024-02-26 12:30 - 17:30 -80.20650 -2.012791 16 5.0 X4._12240226 X6.Daule 136.5 2024-02-26 11:10 - 13:30 -80.54957 -2.104592 7 2.3 X6._11240226 X3.Pigio 140.5 2024-02-26 06:00 - 09:30 -80.80350 -1.638905 8 3.5 X3._06240226 X4.Guasmo 140.5 2024-02-26 06:00 - 09:30 -80.25439 -2.009429 8 3.5 X4._06240226 X6.Daule 141.5 2024-02-26 06:00 - 08:30 -80.49699 -2.077846 6 2.5 X6._06240226 X3.Pigio 156.5 2024-02-25 15:00 - 17:30 -80.80331 -1.638745 6 2.5 X3._15240225 X3.Pigio 159.2 2024-02-25 12:30 - 14:50 -80.80385 -1.640311 7 2.3 X3._12240225 X4.Guasmo 158.0 2024-02-25 12:00 - 16:00 -80.25445 -2.009858 9 4.0 X4._12240225 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
