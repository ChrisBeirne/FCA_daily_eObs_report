This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X1.Guayas 0.0 2023-12-10 12:00 - 14:00 -80.70291 -1.439139 3 2.0 X1._12231210 X1.Guayas 4.0 2023-12-10 06:00 - 10:00 -80.72300 -1.413133 5 4.0 X1._06231210 X1.Guayas 21.0 2023-12-09 14:00 - 17:00 -80.72335 -1.413152 4 3.0 X1._14231209 X3.Pigio 24.0 2023-12-09 12:10 - 14:00 -80.70780 -1.429347 5 1.8 X3._12231209 X1.Guayas 26.0 2023-12-09 06:00 - 12:00 -80.72115 -1.374513 7 6.0 X1._06231209 X1.Guayas 45.0 2023-12-08 11:00 - 17:00 -80.72129 -1.374604 7 6.0 X1._11231208 X1.Guayas 53.0 2023-12-08 06:00 - 09:00 -80.64152 -1.567240 4 3.0 X1._06231208 X2.Quil 72.0 2023-12-07 11:30 - 14:00 -80.71751 -1.739668 5 2.5 X2._11231207 X3.Pigio 70.5 2023-12-07 07:30 - 15:30 -80.70193 -1.468363 17 8.0 X3._07231207 X1.Guayas 77.0 2023-12-07 06:00 - 09:00 -80.65463 -1.595716 4 3.0 X1._06231207 X3.Pigio 79.0 2023-12-07 05:30 - 07:00 -80.69937 -1.467210 4 1.5 X3._05231207 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-12-06 14:30 - 17:00 -80.69941 -1.467197 8 2.5 X3._14231206 X2.Quil 96.0 2023-12-06 12:40 - 14:00 -80.71587 -1.741247 5 1.3 X2._12231206 X3.Pigio 97.5 2023-12-06 10:30 - 12:30 -80.71031 -1.399446 5 2.0 X3._10231206 X1.Guayas 101.0 2023-12-06 06:00 - 09:00 -80.75325 -1.652052 4 3.0 X1._06231206 X3.Pigio 100.0 2023-12-06 05:30 - 10:00 -80.71131 -1.399104 10 4.5 X3._05231206 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-12-05 08:20 - 17:00 -80.71138 -1.399735 22 8.7 X3._08231205 X1.Guayas 123.0 2023-12-05 06:00 - 11:00 -80.76521 -1.642283 6 5.0 X1._06231205 X3.Pigio 126.0 2023-12-05 05:30 - 08:00 -80.70194 -1.410430 6 2.5 X3._05231205 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-12-04 15:30 - 17:00 -80.70193 -1.410344 6 1.5 X3._15231204 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-12-04 14:01 - 17:00 -80.76541 -1.642605 4 3.0 X1._14231204 X3.Pigio 143.5 2023-12-04 13:10 - 14:30 -80.68409 -1.411693 5 1.3 X3._13231204 X1.Guayas 148.0 2023-12-04 06:00 - 10:00 -80.74292 -1.697777 4 4.0 X1._06231204 X3.Pigio 150.0 2023-12-04 05:30 - 08:00 -80.70237 -1.468149 6 2.5 X3._05231204 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
