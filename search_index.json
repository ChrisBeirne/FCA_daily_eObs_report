This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 3.5 2023-12-12 07:00 - 10:30 -80.74617 -1.657073 8 3.5 X3._07231212 X3.Pigio 21.0 2023-12-11 13:40 - 17:00 -80.74530 -1.657715 9 3.3 X3._13231211 X1.Guayas 22.0 2023-12-11 13:00 - 16:00 -80.70812 -1.430269 4 3.0 X1._13231211 X1.Guayas 29.0 2023-12-11 06:00 - 09:00 -80.70885 -1.427520 4 3.0 X1._06231211 X3.Pigio 27.0 2023-12-11 05:30 - 11:00 -80.72233 -1.638088 12 5.5 X3._05231211 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-12-10 14:00 - 17:00 -80.72254 -1.638048 10 3.0 X3._14231210 X1.Guayas 46.0 2023-12-10 12:00 - 16:00 -80.70294 -1.439134 5 4.0 X1._12231210 X1.Guayas 52.0 2023-12-10 06:00 - 10:00 -80.72300 -1.413133 5 4.0 X1._06231210 X3.Pigio 54.0 2023-12-10 05:30 - 08:00 -80.70888 -1.429220 6 2.5 X3._05231210 X1.Guayas 69.0 2023-12-09 14:00 - 17:00 -80.72335 -1.413152 4 3.0 X1._14231209 X3.Pigio 72.0 2023-12-09 11:40 - 14:00 -80.70780 -1.429347 9 2.3 X3._11231209 X1.Guayas 74.0 2023-12-09 06:00 - 12:00 -80.72115 -1.374513 7 6.0 X1._06231209 X3.Pigio 75.5 2023-12-09 05:30 - 10:30 -80.72114 -1.374931 11 5.0 X3._05231209 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-12-08 15:00 - 17:00 -80.72121 -1.374719 5 2.0 X3._15231208 X3.Pigio 97.5 2023-12-08 11:10 - 12:30 -80.72280 -1.380004 5 1.3 X3._11231208 X1.Guayas 93.0 2023-12-08 11:00 - 17:00 -80.72129 -1.374604 7 6.0 X1._11231208 X3.Pigio 101.5 2023-12-08 06:30 - 08:30 -80.70291 -1.468702 5 2.0 X3._06231208 X1.Guayas 101.0 2023-12-08 06:00 - 09:00 -80.64152 -1.567240 4 3.0 X1._06231208 X2.Quil 120.0 2023-12-07 11:30 - 14:00 -80.71751 -1.739668 5 2.5 X2._11231207 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-12-07 07:30 - 17:00 -80.70205 -1.468357 20 9.5 X3._07231207 X1.Guayas 125.0 2023-12-07 06:00 - 09:00 -80.65463 -1.595716 4 3.0 X1._06231207 X3.Pigio 127.0 2023-12-07 05:30 - 07:00 -80.69937 -1.467210 4 1.5 X3._05231207 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-12-06 14:30 - 17:00 -80.69941 -1.467197 8 2.5 X3._14231206 X2.Quil 144.0 2023-12-06 12:40 - 14:00 -80.71587 -1.741247 5 1.3 X2._12231206 X3.Pigio 145.5 2023-12-06 10:30 - 12:30 -80.71031 -1.399446 5 2.0 X3._10231206 X1.Guayas 149.0 2023-12-06 06:00 - 09:00 -80.75325 -1.652052 4 3.0 X1._06231206 X3.Pigio 148.0 2023-12-06 05:30 - 10:00 -80.71131 -1.399104 10 4.5 X3._05231206 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
