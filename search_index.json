This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 0.0 2023-12-13 09:10 - 14:00 -80.44578 -1.641014 16 4.8 X2._09231213 X1.Guayas 3.0 2023-12-13 09:00 - 11:00 -80.70762 -1.429244 3 2.0 X1._09231213 X4.Guasmo 5.0 2023-12-13 07:00 - 09:00 -80.11526 -2.006576 3 2.0 X4._07231213 X2.Quil 6.0 2023-12-13 05:30 - 08:00 -80.64200 -1.648476 8 2.5 X2._05231213 X2.Quil 21.0 2023-12-12 14:30 - 17:00 -80.64182 -1.648712 6 2.5 X2._14231212 X4.Guasmo 22.0 2023-12-12 11:00 - 16:00 -80.11429 -2.005175 6 5.0 X4._11231212 X3.Pigio 27.5 2023-12-12 07:00 - 10:30 -80.74617 -1.657073 8 3.5 X3._07231212 X4.Guasmo 29.0 2023-12-12 06:00 - 09:00 -80.09395 -2.020830 4 3.0 X4._06231212 X2.Quil 26.5 2023-12-12 05:30 - 11:30 -80.64901 -1.664536 13 6.0 X2._05231212 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-12-11 13:40 - 17:00 -80.74530 -1.657715 9 3.3 X3._13231211 X1.Guayas 46.0 2023-12-11 13:00 - 16:00 -80.70812 -1.430269 4 3.0 X1._13231211 X4.Guasmo 45.0 2023-12-11 09:00 - 17:00 -80.09357 -2.021241 9 8.0 X4._09231211 X2.Quil 46.0 2023-12-11 08:50 - 16:00 -80.64899 -1.664640 17 7.2 X2._08231211 X4.Guasmo 54.0 2023-12-11 06:00 - 08:00 -80.09427 -2.020729 3 2.0 X4._06231211 X1.Guayas 53.0 2023-12-11 06:00 - 09:00 -80.70885 -1.427520 4 3.0 X1._06231211 X3.Pigio 51.0 2023-12-11 05:30 - 11:00 -80.72233 -1.638088 12 5.5 X3._05231211 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-12-10 14:00 - 17:00 -80.72254 -1.638048 10 3.0 X3._14231210 X2.Quil 70.0 2023-12-10 13:40 - 16:00 -80.64961 -1.662834 7 2.3 X2._13231210 X1.Guayas 70.0 2023-12-10 12:00 - 16:00 -80.70294 -1.439134 5 4.0 X1._12231210 X4.Guasmo 69.0 2023-12-10 08:00 - 17:00 -80.09342 -2.020869 10 9.0 X4._08231210 X1.Guayas 76.0 2023-12-10 06:00 - 10:00 -80.72300 -1.413133 5 4.0 X1._06231210 X2.Quil 78.5 2023-12-10 05:30 - 07:30 -80.64606 -1.666476 5 2.0 X2._05231210 X3.Pigio 78.0 2023-12-10 05:30 - 08:00 -80.70888 -1.429220 6 2.5 X3._05231210 X1.Guayas 93.0 2023-12-09 14:00 - 17:00 -80.72335 -1.413152 4 3.0 X1._14231209 X2.Quil 93.0 2023-12-09 14:00 - 17:00 -80.64803 -1.666783 9 3.0 X2._14231209 X3.Pigio 96.0 2023-12-09 11:40 - 14:00 -80.70780 -1.429347 9 2.3 X3._11231209 X4.Guasmo 93.0 2023-12-09 11:00 - 17:00 -80.09389 -2.020840 12 6.0 X4._11231209 X2.Quil 99.0 2023-12-09 09:30 - 11:00 -80.69462 -1.638178 4 1.5 X2._09231209 X2.Quil 101.5 2023-12-09 07:00 - 08:30 -80.69528 -1.638236 4 1.5 X2._07231209 X1.Guayas 98.0 2023-12-09 06:00 - 12:00 -80.72115 -1.374513 7 6.0 X1._06231209 X4.Guasmo 100.0 2023-12-09 06:00 - 10:00 -80.11643 -2.050800 5 4.0 X4._06231209 X3.Pigio 99.5 2023-12-09 05:30 - 10:30 -80.72114 -1.374931 11 5.0 X3._05231209 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-12-08 15:00 - 17:00 -80.72121 -1.374719 5 2.0 X3._15231208 X2.Quil 118.5 2023-12-08 14:00 - 15:30 -80.69446 -1.638447 4 1.5 X2._14231208 X3.Pigio 121.5 2023-12-08 11:10 - 12:30 -80.72280 -1.380004 5 1.3 X3._11231208 X1.Guayas 117.0 2023-12-08 11:00 - 17:00 -80.72129 -1.374604 7 6.0 X1._11231208 X2.Quil 121.0 2023-12-08 10:40 - 13:01 -80.69590 -1.636641 9 2.4 X2._10231208 X3.Pigio 125.5 2023-12-08 06:30 - 08:30 -80.70291 -1.468702 5 2.0 X3._06231208 X1.Guayas 125.0 2023-12-08 06:00 - 09:00 -80.64152 -1.567240 4 3.0 X1._06231208 X4.Guasmo 117.0 2023-12-08 06:00 - 17:00 -80.11705 -2.051053 16 11.0 X4._06231208 X2.Quil 125.5 2023-12-08 05:30 - 08:30 -80.71508 -1.739183 9 3.0 X2._05231208 X4.Guasmo 141.0 2023-12-07 15:30 - 17:00 -80.11779 -2.050547 4 1.5 X4._15231207 X2.Quil 143.5 2023-12-07 09:30 - 14:30 -80.71765 -1.739412 11 5.0 X2._09231207 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-12-07 07:30 - 17:00 -80.70205 -1.468357 20 9.5 X3._07231207 X1.Guayas 149.0 2023-12-07 06:00 - 09:00 -80.65463 -1.595716 4 3.0 X1._06231207 X3.Pigio 151.0 2023-12-07 05:30 - 07:00 -80.69937 -1.467210 4 1.5 X3._05231207 X4.Guasmo 143.0 2023-12-07 05:30 - 15:00 -80.11668 -2.051157 21 9.5 X4._05231207 X2.Quil 150.0 2023-12-07 05:30 - 08:00 -80.71539 -1.741129 6 2.5 X2._05231207 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
