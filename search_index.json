This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X1.Guayas 13.0 2023-10-24 14:00 - 17:00 -80.08353 -2.145954 5 3.0 X1._14231024 X1.Guayas 46.0 2023-10-23 06:00 - 08:00 -80.54902 -1.913493 3 2.0 X1._06231023 X2.Quil 61.5 2023-10-22 14:30 - 16:30 -80.50984 -1.628305 5 2.0 X2._14231022 X1.Guayas 61.0 2023-10-22 14:00 - 17:00 -80.54957 -1.913217 5 3.0 X1._14231022 X2.Quil 64.0 2023-10-22 12:20 - 14:00 -80.51008 -1.631778 7 1.7 X2._12231022 X1.Guayas 64.5 2023-10-22 09:00 - 13:30 -80.54889 -1.912536 10 4.5 X1._09231022 X2.Quil 68.0 2023-10-22 08:00 - 10:00 -80.44063 -1.643307 5 2.0 X2._08231022 X1.Guayas 69.5 2023-10-22 05:30 - 08:30 -80.54865 -1.913630 7 3.0 X1._05231022 X2.Quil 70.5 2023-10-22 05:30 - 07:30 -80.44174 -1.643230 5 2.0 X2._05231022 X2.Quil 85.5 2023-10-21 12:00 - 16:30 -80.43824 -1.641734 12 4.5 X2._12231021 X2.Quil 90.5 2023-10-21 09:00 - 11:30 -80.44112 -1.643020 8 2.5 X2._09231021 X1.Guayas 85.5 2023-10-21 05:30 - 16:30 -80.54874 -1.913699 23 11.0 X1._05231021 X2.Quil 93.2 2023-10-21 05:30 - 08:50 -80.44051 -1.643536 9 3.3 X2._05231021 X1.Guayas 109.0 2023-10-20 13:51 - 17:00 -80.54839 -1.913886 9 3.1 X1._13231020 X4.Guasmo 110.0 2023-10-20 06:30 - 16:00 -80.09163 -2.014808 20 9.5 X4._06231020 X2.Quil 109.0 2023-10-20 05:30 - 17:00 -80.44093 -1.643570 30 11.5 X2._05231020 X3.Pigio 117.5 2023-10-20 05:30 - 08:30 -80.56963 -1.584222 7 3.0 X3._05231020 X3.Pigio 136.0 2023-10-19 12:40 - 14:00 -80.56460 -1.602172 6 1.3 X3._12231019 X4.Guasmo 134.5 2023-10-19 06:30 - 15:30 -80.09154 -2.014621 19 9.0 X4._06231019 X3.Pigio 141.5 2023-10-19 05:30 - 08:30 -80.56912 -1.586268 7 3.0 X3._05231019 X2.Quil 133.0 2023-10-19 05:30 - 17:00 -80.44087 -1.643463 28 11.5 X2._05231019 X2.Quil 157.0 2023-10-18 13:00 - 17:00 -80.44152 -1.643991 9 4.0 X2._13231018 X1.Guayas 157.0 2023-10-18 12:30 - 17:00 -80.19089 -2.009048 10 4.5 X1._12231018 X3.Pigio 157.0 2023-10-18 11:30 - 17:00 -80.56950 -1.586262 12 5.5 X3._11231018 X4.Guasmo 157.0 2023-10-18 10:30 - 17:00 -80.09469 -2.015554 16 6.5 X4._10231018 X2.Quil 165.0 2023-10-18 07:00 - 09:00 -80.53635 -1.926193 3 2.0 X2._07231018 X4.Guasmo 165.5 2023-10-18 07:00 - 08:30 -80.09156 -2.014986 4 1.5 X4._07231018 X1.Guayas 165.5 2023-10-18 07:00 - 08:30 -80.20129 -1.997341 4 1.5 X1._07231018 X3.Pigio 163.0 2023-10-18 06:50 - 11:00 -80.56978 -1.585265 12 4.2 X3._06231018 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
