This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X1.Guayas 13.0 2023-12-15 11:00 - 17:00 -80.71465 -1.379789 7 6.0 X1._11231215 X1.Guayas 22.0 2023-12-15 06:00 - 08:00 -80.69141 -1.317598 3 2.0 X1._06231215 X2.Quil 41.5 2023-12-14 10:00 - 12:30 -80.44562 -1.646760 8 2.5 X2._10231214 X1.Guayas 37.0 2023-12-14 06:00 - 17:00 -80.69137 -1.317642 12 11.0 X1._06231214 X2.Quil 46.5 2023-12-14 05:30 - 07:30 -80.44549 -1.641644 5 2.0 X2._05231214 X2.Quil 61.0 2023-12-13 13:30 - 17:00 -80.44582 -1.641818 9 3.5 X2._13231213 X1.Guayas 61.0 2023-12-13 13:00 - 17:00 -80.69136 -1.317659 5 4.0 X1._13231213 X2.Quil 65.0 2023-12-13 10:00 - 13:00 -80.44573 -1.640729 11 3.0 X2._10231213 X1.Guayas 67.0 2023-12-13 09:00 - 11:00 -80.70762 -1.429244 3 2.0 X1._09231213 X4.Guasmo 69.0 2023-12-13 07:00 - 09:00 -80.11526 -2.006576 3 2.0 X4._07231213 X1.Guayas 70.0 2023-12-13 06:00 - 08:00 -80.70894 -1.430037 3 2.0 X1._06231213 X2.Quil 70.0 2023-12-13 05:30 - 08:00 -80.64200 -1.648476 8 2.5 X2._05231213 X2.Quil 85.0 2023-12-12 14:30 - 17:00 -80.64182 -1.648712 6 2.5 X2._14231212 X1.Guayas 85.0 2023-12-12 14:00 - 17:00 -80.70884 -1.429998 4 3.0 X1._14231212 X4.Guasmo 86.0 2023-12-12 11:00 - 16:00 -80.11429 -2.005175 6 5.0 X4._11231212 X1.Guayas 89.0 2023-12-12 09:00 - 13:00 -80.70758 -1.429249 5 4.0 X1._09231212 X3.Pigio 91.5 2023-12-12 07:00 - 10:30 -80.74617 -1.657073 8 3.5 X3._07231212 X1.Guayas 94.0 2023-12-12 06:00 - 08:00 -80.70821 -1.430308 3 2.0 X1._06231212 X4.Guasmo 93.0 2023-12-12 06:00 - 09:00 -80.09395 -2.020830 4 3.0 X4._06231212 X2.Quil 90.5 2023-12-12 05:30 - 11:30 -80.64901 -1.664536 13 6.0 X2._05231212 X3.Pigio 109.0 2023-12-11 13:40 - 17:00 -80.74530 -1.657715 9 3.3 X3._13231211 X1.Guayas 109.0 2023-12-11 13:00 - 17:00 -80.70813 -1.430249 5 4.0 X1._13231211 X4.Guasmo 109.0 2023-12-11 09:00 - 17:00 -80.09357 -2.021241 9 8.0 X4._09231211 X2.Quil 110.0 2023-12-11 08:50 - 16:00 -80.64899 -1.664640 17 7.2 X2._08231211 X4.Guasmo 118.0 2023-12-11 06:00 - 08:00 -80.09427 -2.020729 3 2.0 X4._06231211 X1.Guayas 117.0 2023-12-11 06:00 - 09:00 -80.70885 -1.427520 4 3.0 X1._06231211 X3.Pigio 115.0 2023-12-11 05:30 - 11:00 -80.72233 -1.638088 12 5.5 X3._05231211 X3.Pigio 133.0 2023-12-10 14:00 - 17:00 -80.72254 -1.638048 10 3.0 X3._14231210 X2.Quil 134.0 2023-12-10 13:40 - 16:00 -80.64961 -1.662834 7 2.3 X2._13231210 X1.Guayas 134.0 2023-12-10 12:00 - 16:00 -80.70294 -1.439134 5 4.0 X1._12231210 X4.Guasmo 133.0 2023-12-10 08:00 - 17:00 -80.09342 -2.020869 10 9.0 X4._08231210 X1.Guayas 140.0 2023-12-10 06:00 - 10:00 -80.72300 -1.413133 5 4.0 X1._06231210 X2.Quil 142.5 2023-12-10 05:30 - 07:30 -80.64606 -1.666476 5 2.0 X2._05231210 X3.Pigio 142.0 2023-12-10 05:30 - 08:00 -80.70888 -1.429220 6 2.5 X3._05231210 X1.Guayas 157.0 2023-12-09 14:00 - 17:00 -80.72335 -1.413152 4 3.0 X1._14231209 X2.Quil 157.0 2023-12-09 14:00 - 17:00 -80.64803 -1.666783 9 3.0 X2._14231209 X4.Guasmo 157.0 2023-12-09 12:00 - 17:00 -80.09389 -2.020840 8 5.0 X4._12231209 X3.Pigio 160.0 2023-12-09 11:40 - 14:00 -80.70780 -1.429347 9 2.3 X3._11231209 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
