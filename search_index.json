This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 13.0 2023-11-07 14:40 - 17:00 -80.47856 -1.271041 7 2.3 X2._14231107 X2.Quil 15.5 2023-11-07 12:50 - 14:30 -80.48816 -1.261265 8 1.7 X2._12231107 X3.Pigio 19.5 2023-11-07 07:00 - 10:30 -80.08388 -1.995153 8 3.5 X3._07231107 X2.Quil 19.5 2023-11-07 05:30 - 10:30 -80.61055 -1.203685 11 5.0 X2._05231107 X4.Guasmo 13.5 2023-11-07 05:00 - 16:30 -80.12305 -2.049733 24 11.5 X4._05231107 X4.Guasmo 39.0 2023-11-06 13:30 - 15:00 -80.12175 -2.047259 6 1.5 X4._13231106 X3.Pigio 39.2 2023-11-06 13:20 - 14:50 -80.07896 -1.990606 7 1.5 X3._13231106 X2.Quil 38.5 2023-11-06 13:10 - 15:31 -80.64795 -1.250855 7 2.3 X2._13231106 X4.Guasmo 44.0 2023-11-06 07:00 - 10:00 -80.11806 -2.081987 7 3.0 X4._07231106 X2.Quil 47.0 2023-11-06 05:30 - 07:00 -80.68829 -1.323646 4 1.5 X2._05231106 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-11-06 05:00 - 09:00 -80.11784 -2.081759 9 4.0 X3._05231106 X4.Guasmo 61.0 2023-11-05 15:00 - 17:00 -80.11795 -2.081716 7 2.0 X4._15231105 X3.Pigio 62.0 2023-11-05 14:20 - 16:00 -80.11768 -2.081627 6 1.7 X3._14231105 X3.Pigio 65.5 2023-11-05 11:00 - 12:30 -79.96515 -2.167062 6 1.5 X3._11231105 X2.Quil 64.0 2023-11-05 09:30 - 14:00 -80.68718 -1.326263 12 4.5 X2._09231105 X4.Guasmo 67.5 2023-11-05 09:00 - 10:30 -80.14898 -2.038414 4 1.5 X4._09231105 X3.Pigio 70.0 2023-11-05 06:30 - 08:00 -79.98677 -2.162479 4 1.5 X3._06231105 X4.Guasmo 69.5 2023-11-05 05:30 - 08:30 -80.14913 -2.041523 7 3.0 X4._05231105 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-11-05 05:30 - 09:00 -80.68785 -1.325652 8 3.5 X2._05231105 X2.Quil 85.0 2023-11-04 15:00 - 17:00 -80.68787 -1.324831 5 2.0 X2._15231104 X2.Quil 87.5 2023-11-04 12:00 - 14:30 -80.68765 -1.325853 9 2.5 X2._12231104 X4.Guasmo 89.5 2023-11-04 09:00 - 12:30 -80.14727 -2.028922 8 3.5 X4._09231104 X4.Guasmo 93.5 2023-11-04 06:30 - 08:30 -80.14944 -2.029483 5 2.0 X4._06231104 X2.Quil 93.0 2023-11-04 05:10 - 09:00 -80.59577 -1.382962 10 3.8 X2._05231104 X3.Pigio 95.5 2023-11-04 05:00 - 06:30 -80.01603 -2.165466 4 1.5 X3._05231104 X3.Pigio 109.0 2023-11-03 15:00 - 17:00 -80.01611 -2.165386 7 2.0 X3._15231103 X4.Guasmo 109.0 2023-11-03 11:30 - 17:00 -80.14598 -2.028859 12 5.5 X4._11231103 X2.Quil 109.0 2023-11-03 10:40 - 17:00 -80.59544 -1.382905 20 6.3 X2._10231103 X3.Pigio 115.0 2023-11-03 09:20 - 11:00 -80.37962 -2.410071 6 1.7 X3._09231103 X4.Guasmo 115.0 2023-11-03 07:30 - 11:00 -80.14731 -2.028813 8 3.5 X4._07231103 X3.Pigio 118.0 2023-11-03 05:30 - 08:00 -80.49424 -2.453616 6 2.5 X3._05231103 X2.Quil 119.2 2023-11-03 05:30 - 06:50 -80.55414 -1.402389 5 1.3 X2._05231103 X4.Guasmo 119.0 2023-11-03 05:30 - 07:00 -80.14972 -2.029354 4 1.5 X4._05231103 X4.Guasmo 133.0 2023-11-02 12:30 - 17:00 -80.14973 -2.028471 10 4.5 X4._12231102 X2.Quil 136.5 2023-11-02 11:00 - 13:30 -80.59577 -1.382896 11 2.5 X2._11231102 X1.Guayas 140.0 2023-11-02 08:00 - 10:00 -80.17239 -2.158006 3 2.0 X1._08231102 X4.Guasmo 138.0 2023-11-02 07:30 - 12:00 -80.14952 -2.029618 14 4.5 X4._07231102 X2.Quil 142.5 2023-11-02 05:30 - 07:30 -80.60026 -1.475189 5 2.0 X2._05231102 X3.Pigio 140.5 2023-11-02 05:30 - 09:30 -80.48266 -2.459378 8 4.0 X3._05231102 X1.Guayas 143.0 2023-11-02 05:00 - 07:00 -80.17122 -2.157974 3 2.0 X1._05231102 X2.Quil 158.0 2023-11-01 14:30 - 16:00 -80.59999 -1.476059 4 1.5 X2._14231101 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
