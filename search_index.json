This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X1.Guayas 0.0 2023-10-18 12:30 - 14:00 -80.19069 -2.009094 4 1.5 X1._12231018 X2.Quil 0.0 2023-10-18 11:50 - 14:00 -80.44105 -1.643708 9 2.2 X2._11231018 X2.Quil 5.0 2023-10-18 05:30 - 09:00 -80.53635 -1.926193 6 3.5 X2._05231018 X2.Quil 21.0 2023-10-17 14:40 - 17:00 -80.53659 -1.926071 7 2.3 X2._14231017 X2.Quil 23.5 2023-10-17 11:00 - 14:30 -80.54630 -1.912693 10 3.5 X2._11231017 X2.Quil 28.5 2023-10-17 05:30 - 09:30 -80.54842 -1.913136 8 4.0 X2._05231017 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-10-16 12:40 - 17:00 -80.55051 -1.567470 11 4.3 X3._12231016 X2.Quil 45.0 2023-10-16 12:00 - 17:00 -80.54826 -1.912966 11 5.0 X2._12231016 X1.Guayas 48.5 2023-10-16 11:30 - 13:30 -80.29041 -2.022454 4 2.0 X1._11231016 X3.Pigio 51.5 2023-10-16 09:00 - 10:30 -80.54077 -1.573068 4 1.5 X3._09231016 X3.Pigio 53.5 2023-10-16 06:30 - 08:30 -80.53997 -1.572487 5 2.0 X3._06231016 X2.Quil 50.5 2023-10-16 06:00 - 11:30 -80.54915 -1.911379 11 5.5 X2._06231016 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-10-15 15:30 - 17:00 -80.53995 -1.572681 4 1.5 X3._15231015 X3.Pigio 74.0 2023-10-15 09:00 - 12:00 -80.54390 -1.572721 7 3.0 X3._09231015 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-10-15 05:30 - 17:00 -80.54925 -1.911367 27 11.5 X2._05231015 X3.Pigio 78.0 2023-10-15 05:30 - 08:00 -80.53680 -1.569292 6 2.5 X3._05231015 X3.Pigio 99.5 2023-10-14 08:30 - 10:30 -80.54403 -1.572751 5 2.0 X3._08231014 X3.Pigio 102.0 2023-10-14 05:30 - 08:00 -80.56923 -1.566292 6 2.5 X3._05231014 X2.Quil 100.5 2023-10-14 05:30 - 09:30 -80.65369 -1.870564 11 4.0 X2._05231014 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-10-13 15:30 - 17:00 -80.56947 -1.566176 4 1.5 X3._15231013 X3.Pigio 119.0 2023-10-13 13:30 - 15:00 -80.57033 -1.564996 4 1.5 X3._13231013 X2.Quil 117.0 2023-10-13 09:00 - 17:00 -80.65378 -1.870089 20 8.0 X2._09231013 X3.Pigio 125.0 2023-10-13 07:30 - 09:00 -80.61871 -1.552365 4 1.5 X3._07231013 X2.Quil 125.5 2023-10-13 05:30 - 08:30 -80.65457 -1.870736 7 3.0 X2._05231013 X3.Pigio 142.0 2023-10-12 13:50 - 16:00 -80.62723 -1.550586 6 2.2 X3._13231012 X1.Guayas 144.0 2023-10-12 11:30 - 14:00 -80.08817 -2.143733 6 2.5 X1._11231012 X1.Guayas 148.0 2023-10-12 06:30 - 10:00 -80.08653 -2.142611 8 3.5 X1._06231012 X2.Quil 141.0 2023-10-12 05:30 - 17:00 -80.65371 -1.870524 27 11.5 X2._05231012 X3.Pigio 150.5 2023-10-12 05:30 - 07:30 -80.61875 -1.556055 5 2.0 X3._05231012 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
