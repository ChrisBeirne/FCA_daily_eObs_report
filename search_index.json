This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 31.5 2023-11-04 05:00 - 06:30 -80.01603 -2.165466 4 1.5 X3._05231104 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-11-03 15:00 - 17:00 -80.01611 -2.165386 7 2.0 X3._15231103 X4.Guasmo 48.0 2023-11-03 11:30 - 14:00 -80.14587 -2.028822 5 2.5 X4._11231103 X2.Quil 48.0 2023-11-03 10:40 - 14:00 -80.59561 -1.382884 14 3.3 X2._10231103 X3.Pigio 51.0 2023-11-03 09:20 - 11:00 -80.37962 -2.410071 6 1.7 X3._09231103 X3.Pigio 54.0 2023-11-03 05:30 - 08:00 -80.49424 -2.453616 6 2.5 X3._05231103 X2.Quil 55.2 2023-11-03 05:30 - 06:50 -80.55414 -1.402389 5 1.3 X2._05231103 X2.Quil 72.5 2023-11-02 11:00 - 13:30 -80.59577 -1.382896 11 2.5 X2._11231102 X1.Guayas 76.0 2023-11-02 08:00 - 10:00 -80.17239 -2.158006 3 2.0 X1._08231102 X2.Quil 78.5 2023-11-02 05:30 - 07:30 -80.60026 -1.475189 5 2.0 X2._05231102 X3.Pigio 76.5 2023-11-02 05:30 - 09:30 -80.48266 -2.459378 8 4.0 X3._05231102 X1.Guayas 79.0 2023-11-02 05:00 - 07:00 -80.17122 -2.157974 3 2.0 X1._05231102 X2.Quil 94.0 2023-11-01 14:30 - 16:00 -80.59999 -1.476059 4 1.5 X2._14231101 X3.Pigio 95.5 2023-11-01 13:10 - 14:30 -80.48603 -2.460634 5 1.3 X3._13231101 X2.Quil 96.0 2023-11-01 11:30 - 14:00 -80.59401 -1.470509 8 2.5 X2._11231101 X1.Guayas 95.0 2023-11-01 09:00 - 15:00 -80.17241 -2.158056 7 6.0 X1._09231101 X2.Quil 99.5 2023-11-01 05:30 - 10:30 -80.61179 -1.480957 13 5.0 X2._05231101 X3.Pigio 97.0 2023-11-01 05:30 - 13:00 -80.48485 -2.460939 16 7.5 X3._05231101 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-10-31 13:30 - 17:00 -80.48456 -2.461132 10 3.5 X3._13231031 X1.Guayas 118.0 2023-10-31 13:00 - 16:00 -80.17149 -2.157610 4 3.0 X1._13231031 X2.Quil 117.0 2023-10-31 06:30 - 17:00 -80.61172 -1.480888 23 10.5 X2._06231031 X3.Pigio 126.0 2023-10-31 06:00 - 08:00 -80.43593 -2.514198 5 2.0 X3._06231031 X1.Guayas 125.0 2023-10-31 05:00 - 09:00 -80.31397 -2.094422 5 4.0 X1._05231031 X3.Pigio 142.5 2023-10-30 13:50 - 15:30 -80.43023 -2.512508 6 1.7 X3._13231030 X1.Guayas 145.0 2023-10-30 11:00 - 13:00 -80.32483 -2.105396 3 2.0 X1._11231030 X3.Pigio 149.5 2023-10-30 05:30 - 08:30 -80.52363 -1.921611 7 3.0 X3._05231030 X2.Quil 148.0 2023-10-30 05:30 - 10:00 -80.61165 -1.480636 12 4.5 X2._05231030 X1.Guayas 149.0 2023-10-30 05:00 - 09:00 -80.31436 -2.095015 5 4.0 X1._05231030 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
