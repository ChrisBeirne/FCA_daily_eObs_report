This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 0.0 2023-12-07 11:30 - 14:00 -80.71751 -1.739668 5 2.5 X2._11231207 X2.Quil 24.0 2023-12-06 12:40 - 14:00 -80.71587 -1.741247 5 1.3 X2._12231206 X3.Pigio 25.5 2023-12-06 10:30 - 12:30 -80.71031 -1.399446 5 2.0 X3._10231206 X3.Pigio 28.0 2023-12-06 05:30 - 10:00 -80.71131 -1.399104 10 4.5 X3._05231206 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-12-05 08:20 - 17:00 -80.71138 -1.399735 22 8.7 X3._08231205 X3.Pigio 54.0 2023-12-05 05:30 - 08:00 -80.70194 -1.410430 6 2.5 X3._05231205 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-12-04 15:30 - 17:00 -80.70193 -1.410344 6 1.5 X3._15231204 X3.Pigio 71.5 2023-12-04 13:10 - 14:30 -80.68409 -1.411693 5 1.3 X3._13231204 X3.Pigio 78.0 2023-12-04 05:30 - 08:00 -80.70237 -1.468149 6 2.5 X3._05231204 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-12-03 14:00 - 17:00 -80.70191 -1.468425 7 3.0 X3._14231203 X3.Pigio 96.5 2023-12-03 10:40 - 13:30 -80.70100 -1.468067 8 2.8 X3._10231203 X3.Pigio 100.0 2023-12-03 05:30 - 10:00 -80.70313 -1.469731 15 4.5 X3._05231203 X2.Quil 101.5 2023-12-03 05:30 - 08:30 -80.72799 -1.435246 7 3.0 X2._05231203 X2.Quil 117.0 2023-12-02 15:40 - 17:00 -80.72904 -1.434172 5 1.3 X2._15231202 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-12-02 13:50 - 17:00 -80.70258 -1.469589 11 3.2 X3._13231202 X4.Guasmo 120.0 2023-12-02 12:30 - 14:00 -80.11616 -2.050586 4 1.5 X4._12231202 X3.Pigio 127.0 2023-12-02 05:30 - 07:00 -80.70398 -1.470520 4 1.5 X3._05231202 X2.Quil 126.5 2023-12-02 05:30 - 07:30 -80.72844 -1.507346 5 2.0 X2._05231202 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-12-01 15:30 - 17:00 -80.70389 -1.470584 4 1.5 X3._15231201 X2.Quil 141.5 2023-12-01 15:00 - 16:30 -80.71963 -1.508094 5 1.5 X2._15231201 X4.Guasmo 144.0 2023-12-01 12:30 - 14:00 -80.10915 -2.051083 3 1.5 X4._12231201 X3.Pigio 144.5 2023-12-01 11:30 - 13:30 -80.70309 -1.470616 5 2.0 X3._11231201 X3.Pigio 147.0 2023-12-01 09:00 - 11:00 -80.70333 -1.474557 7 2.0 X3._09231201 X3.Pigio 149.5 2023-12-01 05:30 - 08:30 -80.70286 -1.468888 7 3.0 X3._05231201 X2.Quil 144.0 2023-12-01 05:30 - 14:00 -80.71930 -1.508179 25 8.5 X2._05231201 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
