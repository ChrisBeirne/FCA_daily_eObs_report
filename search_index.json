This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 5.5 2023-10-30 05:30 - 08:30 -80.52363 -1.921611 7 3.0 X3._05231030 X2.Quil 4.0 2023-10-30 05:30 - 10:00 -80.61165 -1.480636 12 4.5 X2._05231030 X3.Pigio 21.0 2023-10-29 10:30 - 17:00 -80.52351 -1.921674 19 6.5 X3._10231029 X2.Quil 21.5 2023-10-29 08:40 - 16:30 -80.60871 -1.481264 18 7.8 X2._08231029 X2.Quil 29.5 2023-10-29 05:30 - 08:30 -80.61178 -1.480750 13 3.0 X2._05231029 X3.Pigio 29.0 2023-10-29 05:30 - 09:00 -80.52072 -1.925951 8 3.5 X3._05231029 X2.Quil 45.0 2023-10-28 13:20 - 17:00 -80.61162 -1.480795 10 3.7 X2._13231028 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-10-28 11:40 - 17:00 -80.52064 -1.926128 13 5.3 X3._11231028 X2.Quil 53.0 2023-10-28 07:30 - 09:00 -80.60918 -1.500652 4 1.5 X2._07231028 X2.Quil 55.0 2023-10-28 05:30 - 07:00 -80.60887 -1.500123 4 1.5 X2._05231028 X4.Guasmo 70.0 2023-10-27 14:00 - 16:00 -80.11060 -2.050854 3 2.0 X4._14231027 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-10-27 11:20 - 17:00 -80.60913 -1.500607 21 5.7 X2._11231027 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-10-27 10:00 - 17:00 -80.76049 -1.590040 8 7.0 X3._10231027 X2.Quil 77.0 2023-10-27 06:00 - 09:00 -80.53726 -1.650272 7 3.0 X2._06231027 X3.Pigio 77.0 2023-10-27 05:30 - 09:00 -80.75954 -1.591189 6 3.5 X3._05231027 X2.Quil 93.0 2023-10-26 15:20 - 17:00 -80.53755 -1.650294 6 1.7 X2._15231026 X2.Quil 95.0 2023-10-26 13:00 - 15:00 -80.53327 -1.661032 5 2.0 X2._13231026 X3.Pigio 97.5 2023-10-26 09:10 - 12:30 -80.76023 -1.590945 11 3.3 X3._09231026 X3.Pigio 102.5 2023-10-26 06:00 - 07:30 -80.74770 -1.591676 4 1.5 X3._06231026 X2.Quil 102.5 2023-10-26 05:30 - 07:30 -80.09853 -2.133316 5 2.0 X2._05231026 X2.Quil 117.0 2023-10-25 15:30 - 17:00 -80.09831 -2.133214 4 1.5 X2._15231025 X2.Quil 119.0 2023-10-25 12:20 - 15:00 -80.09011 -2.133927 8 2.7 X2._12231025 X4.Guasmo 125.5 2023-10-25 07:00 - 08:30 -80.10568 -1.986435 4 1.5 X4._07231025 X1.Guayas 125.0 2023-10-25 05:00 - 09:00 -80.08411 -2.146073 5 4.0 X1._05231025 X2.Quil 126.5 2023-10-25 05:00 - 07:30 -79.99395 -2.166818 8 2.5 X2._05231025 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-10-24 14:00 - 17:00 -80.08353 -2.145954 5 3.0 X1._14231024 X2.Quil 141.0 2023-10-24 13:10 - 17:01 -79.99351 -2.166844 12 3.9 X2._13231024 X3.Pigio 148.5 2023-10-24 08:00 - 09:30 -80.70682 -1.577193 6 1.5 X3._08231024 X3.Pigio 151.0 2023-10-24 05:30 - 07:00 -80.70979 -1.577165 4 1.5 X3._05231024 X2.Quil 148.0 2023-10-24 05:30 - 10:00 -80.07891 -2.134371 10 4.5 X2._05231024 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
