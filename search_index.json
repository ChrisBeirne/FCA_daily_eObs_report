This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 13.0 2023-11-15 15:01 - 17:00 -80.48666 -1.550124 7 2.0 X3._15231115 X4.Guasmo 16.0 2023-11-15 12:00 - 14:00 -80.12827 -2.047671 5 2.0 X4._12231115 X3.Pigio 17.5 2023-11-15 10:40 - 12:30 -80.47434 -1.550329 6 1.8 X3._10231115 X1.Guayas 17.0 2023-11-15 08:00 - 13:00 -80.57617 -1.657612 6 5.0 X1._08231115 X3.Pigio 21.5 2023-11-15 05:30 - 08:30 -80.43352 -1.657559 7 3.0 X3._05231115 X1.Guayas 37.0 2023-11-14 13:00 - 17:00 -80.57301 -1.657879 5 4.0 X1._13231114 X3.Pigio 37.0 2023-11-14 10:00 - 17:00 -80.43300 -1.657316 23 7.0 X3._10231114 X1.Guayas 46.0 2023-11-14 06:00 - 08:00 -80.52089 -1.636562 3 2.0 X1._06231114 X3.Pigio 46.0 2023-11-14 05:30 - 08:00 -80.40880 -1.832794 6 2.5 X3._05231114 X3.Pigio 64.0 2023-11-13 12:10 - 14:00 -80.40941 -1.837298 7 1.8 X3._12231113 X1.Guayas 62.0 2023-11-13 11:00 - 16:00 -80.52556 -1.634695 6 5.0 X1._11231113 X4.Guasmo 67.5 2023-11-13 09:00 - 10:30 -80.11162 -1.989710 4 1.5 X4._09231113 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-11-13 07:30 - 09:00 -80.27414 -1.978335 4 1.5 X3._07231113 X1.Guayas 69.0 2023-11-13 06:02 - 09:00 -80.52555 -1.634729 5 3.0 X1._06231113 X3.Pigio 71.0 2023-11-13 05:30 - 07:00 -80.27500 -1.977493 4 1.5 X3._05231113 X3.Pigio 86.0 2023-11-12 14:30 - 16:00 -80.27565 -1.975470 4 1.5 X3._14231112 X3.Pigio 88.0 2023-11-12 11:50 - 14:00 -80.27512 -1.973303 9 2.2 X3._11231112 X4.Guasmo 86.0 2023-11-12 10:40 - 16:00 -80.11463 -1.985514 13 5.3 X4._10231112 X3.Pigio 94.5 2023-11-12 05:31 - 07:30 -80.19145 -1.979563 5 2.0 X3._05231112 X3.Pigio 109.0 2023-11-11 14:40 - 17:00 -80.19157 -1.979474 7 2.3 X3._14231111 X4.Guasmo 109.0 2023-11-11 14:00 - 17:00 -80.10873 -1.965133 7 3.0 X4._14231111 X4.Guasmo 112.5 2023-11-11 08:30 - 13:30 -80.10822 -1.966742 11 5.0 X4._08231111 X3.Pigio 116.0 2023-11-11 08:10 - 10:00 -80.25398 -1.969681 6 1.8 X3._08231111 X2.Quil 115.0 2023-11-11 07:30 - 11:00 -80.44141 -1.283958 8 3.5 X2._07231111 X1.Guayas 117.0 2023-11-11 06:00 - 09:00 -80.49971 -1.794122 4 3.0 X1._06231111 X3.Pigio 118.5 2023-11-11 05:30 - 07:30 -80.25899 -1.979638 5 2.0 X3._05231111 X4.Guasmo 118.5 2023-11-11 05:00 - 07:30 -80.11035 -1.963161 6 2.5 X4._05231111 X2.Quil 133.0 2023-11-10 15:00 - 17:00 -80.43865 -1.279268 5 2.0 X2._15231110 X3.Pigio 134.0 2023-11-10 11:40 - 16:00 -80.25745 -1.972354 11 4.3 X3._11231110 X4.Guasmo 135.0 2023-11-10 11:30 - 15:00 -80.10786 -1.966270 8 3.5 X4._11231110 X2.Quil 138.5 2023-11-10 06:00 - 11:30 -80.43677 -1.278244 12 5.5 X2._06231110 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-11-10 05:00 - 09:00 -80.11972 -2.137011 5 4.0 X1._05231110 X3.Pigio 141.5 2023-11-10 05:00 - 08:30 -80.09744 -2.103600 8 3.5 X3._05231110 X4.Guasmo 143.0 2023-11-10 05:00 - 07:00 -80.09522 -2.042580 5 2.0 X4._05231110 X2.Quil 159.5 2023-11-09 13:00 - 14:30 -80.43535 -1.277875 4 1.5 X2._13231109 X4.Guasmo 157.5 2023-11-09 12:20 - 16:30 -80.09511 -2.039976 11 4.2 X4._12231109 X3.Pigio 157.5 2023-11-09 12:00 - 16:30 -80.09896 -2.101492 10 4.5 X3._12231109 X2.Quil 161.5 2023-11-09 10:40 - 12:30 -80.43662 -1.277989 6 1.8 X2._10231109 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
