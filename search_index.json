This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X6.Daule 0.0 2024-01-18 12:10 - 14:00 -80.34120 -2.472108 6 1.8 X6._12240118 X6.Daule 5.0 2024-01-18 06:30 - 09:00 -80.25518 -2.359189 6 2.5 X6._06240118 X3.Pigio 4.5 2024-01-18 05:30 - 09:30 -80.77304 -1.692222 9 4.0 X3._05240118 X3.Pigio 20.5 2024-01-17 14:00 - 17:30 -80.77358 -1.693260 8 3.5 X3._14240117 X6.Daule 20.5 2024-01-17 14:00 - 17:30 -80.24837 -2.360692 8 3.5 X6._14240117 X3.Pigio 25.0 2024-01-17 11:40 - 13:00 -80.77156 -1.689439 5 1.3 X3._11240117 X4.Guasmo 25.5 2024-01-17 10:40 - 12:30 -80.13571 -2.048370 6 1.8 X4._10240117 X6.Daule 27.5 2024-01-17 09:00 - 10:30 -80.25391 -2.356905 4 1.5 X6._09240117 X4.Guasmo 28.0 2024-01-17 06:30 - 10:00 -80.13557 -2.048178 10 3.5 X4._06240117 X3.Pigio 27.0 2024-01-17 05:30 - 11:00 -80.77454 -1.687779 12 5.5 X3._05240117 X6.Daule 29.5 2024-01-17 05:30 - 08:30 -80.25230 -2.357031 7 3.0 X6._05240117 X6.Daule 45.0 2024-01-16 15:30 - 17:00 -80.25378 -2.357612 4 1.5 X6._15240116 X4.Guasmo 45.0 2024-01-16 14:00 - 17:00 -80.13558 -2.048063 8 3.0 X4._14240116 X3.Pigio 44.5 2024-01-16 11:50 - 17:30 -80.77471 -1.687880 15 5.7 X3._11240116 X6.Daule 47.0 2024-01-16 11:01 - 15:00 -80.25508 -2.359288 13 4.0 X6._11240116 X3.Pigio 53.0 2024-01-16 07:00 - 09:00 -80.79766 -1.701412 5 2.0 X3._07240116 X4.Guasmo 51.5 2024-01-16 05:30 - 10:30 -80.13551 -2.048368 15 5.0 X4._05240116 X6.Daule 54.5 2024-01-16 05:30 - 07:30 -80.41880 -2.532464 5 2.0 X6._05240116 X6.Daule 69.5 2024-01-15 14:40 - 16:30 -80.41762 -2.530709 6 1.8 X6._14240115 X4.Guasmo 68.5 2024-01-15 12:00 - 17:30 -80.13564 -2.048254 16 5.5 X4._12240115 X3.Pigio 69.0 2024-01-15 11:10 - 17:00 -80.79675 -1.702243 15 5.8 X3._11240115 X3.Pigio 77.0 2024-01-15 05:30 - 09:00 -80.75464 -1.664274 8 3.5 X3._05240115 X4.Guasmo 77.0 2024-01-15 05:30 - 09:00 -80.15665 -2.062271 8 3.5 X4._05240115 X6.Daule 78.0 2024-01-15 05:30 - 08:00 -80.36832 -2.473716 6 2.5 X6._05240115 X4.Guasmo 92.5 2024-01-14 14:10 - 17:30 -80.15664 -2.062269 9 3.3 X4._14240114 X6.Daule 92.5 2024-01-14 14:00 - 17:30 -80.36820 -2.473819 8 3.5 X6._14240114 X3.Pigio 92.5 2024-01-14 13:10 - 17:30 -80.75471 -1.664109 11 4.3 X3._13240114 X3.Pigio 97.8 2024-01-14 08:50 - 12:10 -80.75843 -1.571726 11 3.3 X3._08240114 X3.Pigio 102.0 2024-01-14 05:30 - 08:00 -80.75688 -1.571875 6 2.5 X3._05240114 X4.Guasmo 99.5 2024-01-14 05:30 - 10:30 -80.08385 -1.997789 11 5.0 X4._05240114 X6.Daule 103.0 2024-01-14 05:30 - 07:00 -80.36123 -2.462742 4 1.5 X6._05240114 X3.Pigio 116.5 2024-01-13 14:30 - 17:30 -80.75774 -1.572129 11 3.0 X3._14240113 X6.Daule 116.5 2024-01-13 11:50 - 17:30 -80.36126 -2.462848 14 5.7 X6._11240113 X2.Quil 124.0 2024-01-13 06:00 - 10:00 -80.64477 -1.760192 9 4.0 X2._06240113 X6.Daule 126.0 2024-01-13 05:30 - 08:00 -80.35854 -2.454689 6 2.5 X6._05240113 X3.Pigio 126.5 2024-01-13 05:30 - 07:30 -80.68715 -1.507416 5 2.0 X3._05240113 X2.Quil 140.5 2024-01-12 15:31 - 17:30 -80.64453 -1.760163 5 2.0 X2._15240112 X6.Daule 140.5 2024-01-12 14:30 - 17:30 -80.35757 -2.455297 7 3.0 X6._14240112 X2.Quil 148.5 2024-01-12 07:00 - 09:30 -80.17494 -2.060361 6 2.5 X2._07240112 X4.Guasmo 149.5 2024-01-12 05:30 - 08:30 -80.15436 -2.033113 7 3.0 X4._05240112 X6.Daule 150.0 2024-01-12 05:30 - 08:00 -80.36636 -2.469215 8 2.5 X6._05240112 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
