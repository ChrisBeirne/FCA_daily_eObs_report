This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X6.Daule 28.0 2024-03-18 07:50 - 10:00 -80.68696 -2.131881 7 2.2 X6._07240318 X1.Guayas 45.0 2024-03-17 14:00 - 17:00 -80.54887 -1.921398 3 3.0 X1._14240317 X4.Guasmo 47.0 2024-03-17 13:00 - 15:00 -80.23787 -1.995457 3 2.0 X4._13240317 X6.Daule 44.5 2024-03-17 12:10 - 17:30 -80.68724 -2.132229 13 5.3 X6._12240317 X3.Pigio 52.5 2024-03-17 07:00 - 09:30 -80.69784 -1.720814 6 2.5 X3._07240317 X1.Guayas 54.0 2024-03-17 06:00 - 08:00 -80.52017 -1.954575 3 2.0 X1._06240317 X4.Guasmo 53.0 2024-03-17 06:00 - 09:00 -80.23671 -1.993283 9 3.0 X4._06240317 X6.Daule 53.0 2024-03-17 05:30 - 09:00 -80.29762 -2.061510 6 3.5 X6._05240317 X3.Pigio 68.5 2024-03-16 15:20 - 17:30 -80.69737 -1.719625 7 2.2 X3._15240316 X6.Daule 68.5 2024-03-16 14:10 - 17:30 -80.29778 -2.061767 9 3.3 X6._14240316 X3.Pigio 72.5 2024-03-16 11:50 - 13:30 -80.66490 -1.727617 8 1.7 X3._11240316 X6.Daule 74.5 2024-03-16 10:00 - 11:30 -80.57652 -2.373796 7 1.5 X6._10240316 X1.Guayas 76.0 2024-03-16 06:00 - 10:00 -80.54839 -1.938702 5 4.0 X1._06240316 X6.Daule 76.7 2024-03-16 05:30 - 09:20 -80.57599 -2.373506 9 3.8 X6._05240316 X4.Guasmo 69.0 2024-03-16 05:30 - 17:00 -80.23680 -1.993306 26 11.5 X4._05240316 X6.Daule 92.5 2024-03-15 13:30 - 17:30 -80.57586 -2.373771 13 4.0 X6._13240315 X3.Pigio 94.5 2024-03-15 12:50 - 15:30 -80.65710 -1.757555 8 2.7 X3._12240315 X6.Daule 97.0 2024-03-15 11:40 - 13:00 -80.57429 -2.374949 5 1.3 X6._11240315 X1.Guayas 93.0 2024-03-15 11:00 - 17:00 -80.54827 -1.938675 7 6.0 X1._11240315 X4.Guasmo 93.5 2024-03-15 10:30 - 16:30 -80.23682 -1.993305 13 6.0 X4._10240315 X3.Pigio 101.5 2024-03-15 06:00 - 08:30 -80.63892 -1.745657 6 2.5 X3._06240315 X1.Guayas 100.0 2024-03-15 06:00 - 10:00 -80.53276 -1.926859 5 4.0 X1._06240315 X6.Daule 102.0 2024-03-15 05:30 - 08:01 -80.34875 -2.273396 7 2.5 X6._05240315 X4.Guasmo 100.2 2024-03-15 05:30 - 09:50 -80.23673 -1.993246 14 4.3 X4._05240315 X4.Guasmo 116.5 2024-03-14 14:00 - 17:30 -80.23698 -1.993317 11 3.5 X4._14240314 X6.Daule 118.0 2024-03-14 13:30 - 16:00 -80.34886 -2.280846 8 2.5 X6._13240314 X1.Guayas 119.0 2024-03-14 13:00 - 15:00 -80.53116 -1.888776 3 2.0 X1._13240314 X2.Quil 120.0 2024-03-14 12:40 - 14:00 -80.51563 -1.632711 5 1.3 X2._12240314 X3.Pigio 116.5 2024-03-14 11:00 - 17:30 -80.63766 -1.746457 15 6.5 X3._11240314 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
