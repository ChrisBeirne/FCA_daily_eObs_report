This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 16.0 2023-11-12 12:30 - 14:00 -80.27512 -1.973303 5 1.5 X3._12231112 X4.Guasmo 40.5 2023-11-11 08:30 - 13:30 -80.10822 -1.966742 11 5.0 X4._08231111 X3.Pigio 44.0 2023-11-11 08:10 - 10:00 -80.25398 -1.969681 6 1.8 X3._08231111 X2.Quil 43.0 2023-11-11 07:30 - 11:00 -80.44141 -1.283958 8 3.5 X2._07231111 X1.Guayas 45.0 2023-11-11 06:00 - 09:00 -80.49971 -1.794122 4 3.0 X1._06231111 X3.Pigio 46.5 2023-11-11 05:30 - 07:30 -80.25899 -1.979638 5 2.0 X3._05231111 X4.Guasmo 46.5 2023-11-11 05:00 - 07:30 -80.11035 -1.963161 6 2.5 X4._05231111 X2.Quil 61.0 2023-11-10 15:00 - 17:00 -80.43865 -1.279268 5 2.0 X2._15231110 X3.Pigio 62.0 2023-11-10 11:40 - 16:00 -80.25745 -1.972354 11 4.3 X3._11231110 X4.Guasmo 63.0 2023-11-10 11:30 - 15:00 -80.10786 -1.966270 8 3.5 X4._11231110 X2.Quil 66.5 2023-11-10 06:00 - 11:30 -80.43677 -1.278244 12 5.5 X2._06231110 X1.Guayas 69.0 2023-11-10 05:00 - 09:00 -80.11972 -2.137011 5 4.0 X1._05231110 X3.Pigio 69.5 2023-11-10 05:00 - 08:30 -80.09744 -2.103600 8 3.5 X3._05231110 X4.Guasmo 71.0 2023-11-10 05:00 - 07:00 -80.09522 -2.042580 5 2.0 X4._05231110 X2.Quil 87.5 2023-11-09 13:00 - 14:30 -80.43535 -1.277875 4 1.5 X2._13231109 X4.Guasmo 85.5 2023-11-09 12:20 - 16:30 -80.09511 -2.039976 11 4.2 X4._12231109 X3.Pigio 85.5 2023-11-09 12:00 - 16:30 -80.09896 -2.101492 10 4.5 X3._12231109 X2.Quil 89.5 2023-11-09 10:00 - 12:30 -80.43662 -1.277989 8 2.5 X2._10231109 X4.Guasmo 93.0 2023-11-09 06:40 - 09:00 -80.11804 -2.081807 8 2.3 X4._06231109 X1.Guayas 92.0 2023-11-09 06:00 - 10:00 -80.60114 -1.870371 5 4.0 X1._06231109 X2.Quil 94.5 2023-11-09 05:30 - 07:30 -80.44126 -1.283244 4 2.0 X2._05231109 X3.Pigio 94.0 2023-11-09 05:00 - 08:00 -80.11509 -2.037564 7 3.0 X3._05231109 X3.Pigio 109.0 2023-11-08 14:30 - 17:00 -80.11399 -2.036859 8 2.5 X3._14231108 X2.Quil 109.0 2023-11-08 12:30 - 17:00 -80.44118 -1.282641 10 4.5 X2._12231108 X1.Guayas 109.0 2023-11-08 12:00 - 17:00 -80.60102 -1.870562 6 5.0 X1._12231108 X4.Guasmo 109.5 2023-11-08 10:10 - 16:30 -80.11808 -2.082009 14 6.3 X4._10231108 X2.Quil 114.0 2023-11-08 09:11 - 12:00 -80.44144 -1.283336 8 2.8 X2._09231108 X1.Guayas 116.0 2023-11-08 08:00 - 10:00 -80.60113 -1.870368 3 2.0 X1._08231108 X4.Guasmo 117.0 2023-11-08 06:30 - 09:00 -80.12636 -2.051985 6 2.5 X4._06231108 X2.Quil 118.5 2023-11-08 05:30 - 07:30 -80.47835 -1.270906 7 2.0 X2._05231108 X3.Pigio 119.0 2023-11-08 05:00 - 07:00 -80.20362 -2.016427 5 2.0 X3._05231108 X2.Quil 133.0 2023-11-07 14:40 - 17:00 -80.47856 -1.271041 7 2.3 X2._14231107 X3.Pigio 133.0 2023-11-07 13:30 - 17:00 -80.20390 -2.015480 8 3.5 X3._13231107 X2.Quil 135.5 2023-11-07 12:50 - 14:30 -80.48816 -1.261265 8 1.7 X2._12231107 X3.Pigio 139.5 2023-11-07 07:00 - 10:30 -80.08388 -1.995153 8 3.5 X3._07231107 X2.Quil 139.5 2023-11-07 05:30 - 10:30 -80.61055 -1.203685 11 5.0 X2._05231107 X4.Guasmo 133.5 2023-11-07 05:00 - 16:30 -80.12305 -2.049733 24 11.5 X4._05231107 X4.Guasmo 159.0 2023-11-06 13:30 - 15:00 -80.12175 -2.047259 6 1.5 X4._13231106 X3.Pigio 159.2 2023-11-06 13:20 - 14:50 -80.07896 -1.990606 7 1.5 X3._13231106 X2.Quil 158.5 2023-11-06 13:10 - 15:31 -80.64795 -1.250855 7 2.3 X2._13231106 X4.Guasmo 164.0 2023-11-06 08:00 - 10:00 -80.11806 -2.081987 5 2.0 X4._08231106 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
