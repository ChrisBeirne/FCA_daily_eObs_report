This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 16.5 2024-03-16 11:50 - 13:30 -80.66490 -1.727617 8 1.7 X3._11240316 X4.Guasmo 13.0 2024-03-16 05:30 - 17:00 -80.23680 -1.993306 26 11.5 X4._05240316 X6.Daule 36.5 2024-03-15 13:30 - 17:30 -80.57586 -2.373771 13 4.0 X6._13240315 X3.Pigio 38.5 2024-03-15 12:50 - 15:30 -80.65710 -1.757555 8 2.7 X3._12240315 X6.Daule 41.0 2024-03-15 11:40 - 13:00 -80.57429 -2.374949 5 1.3 X6._11240315 X4.Guasmo 37.5 2024-03-15 10:30 - 16:30 -80.23682 -1.993305 13 6.0 X4._10240315 X3.Pigio 45.5 2024-03-15 06:00 - 08:30 -80.63892 -1.745657 6 2.5 X3._06240315 X6.Daule 46.0 2024-03-15 05:30 - 08:01 -80.34875 -2.273396 7 2.5 X6._05240315 X4.Guasmo 44.2 2024-03-15 05:30 - 09:50 -80.23673 -1.993246 14 4.3 X4._05240315 X4.Guasmo 60.5 2024-03-14 14:00 - 17:30 -80.23698 -1.993317 11 3.5 X4._14240314 X6.Daule 62.0 2024-03-14 13:30 - 16:00 -80.34886 -2.280846 8 2.5 X6._13240314 X2.Quil 64.0 2024-03-14 12:40 - 14:00 -80.51563 -1.632711 5 1.3 X2._12240314 X3.Pigio 60.5 2024-03-14 10:20 - 17:30 -80.63766 -1.746457 18 7.2 X3._10240314 X2.Quil 66.5 2024-03-14 09:50 - 11:30 -80.49488 -1.621123 7 1.7 X2._09240314 X3.Pigio 69.0 2024-03-14 07:30 - 09:00 -80.65987 -1.773817 4 1.5 X3._07240314 X2.Quil 69.0 2024-03-14 07:00 - 09:00 -80.57545 -1.554064 5 2.0 X2._07240314 X4.Guasmo 70.0 2024-03-14 06:00 - 08:00 -80.22318 -2.016693 3 2.0 X4._06240314 X6.Daule 69.0 2024-03-14 05:30 - 09:00 -80.39534 -2.553319 8 3.5 X6._05240314 X2.Quil 84.5 2024-03-13 15:00 - 17:30 -80.57379 -1.556244 6 2.5 X2._15240313 X3.Pigio 85.0 2024-03-13 13:50 - 17:00 -80.65981 -1.773378 8 3.2 X3._13240313 X6.Daule 84.5 2024-03-13 13:30 - 17:30 -80.39552 -2.553405 11 4.0 X6._13240313 X2.Quil 87.5 2024-03-13 12:20 - 14:30 -80.57482 -1.554978 6 2.2 X2._12240313 X6.Daule 92.0 2024-03-13 05:30 - 10:00 -80.40215 -2.559489 12 4.5 X6._05240313 X3.Pigio 93.0 2024-03-13 05:30 - 09:00 -80.64698 -1.786104 7 3.5 X3._05240313 X4.Guasmo 84.5 2024-03-13 05:30 - 17:30 -80.22353 -2.016552 29 12.0 X4._05240313 X3.Pigio 108.5 2024-03-12 15:30 - 17:30 -80.64690 -1.785667 5 2.0 X3._15240312 X2.Quil 108.5 2024-03-12 07:00 - 17:30 -80.67472 -1.575198 24 10.5 X2._07240312 X3.Pigio 117.5 2024-03-12 05:30 - 08:30 -80.64745 -1.818530 15 3.0 X3._05240312 X6.Daule 108.5 2024-03-12 05:30 - 17:30 -80.40214 -2.559342 27 12.0 X6._05240312 X4.Guasmo 108.5 2024-03-12 05:30 - 17:30 -80.22341 -2.016675 25 12.0 X4._05240312 X3.Pigio 132.5 2024-03-11 13:20 - 17:30 -80.64740 -1.818218 13 4.2 X3._13240311 X6.Daule 132.5 2024-03-11 13:00 - 17:30 -80.40228 -2.559482 12 4.5 X6._13240311 X2.Quil 136.5 2024-03-11 11:30 - 13:30 -80.68285 -1.544395 7 2.0 X2._11240311 X4.Guasmo 132.5 2024-03-11 09:50 - 17:30 -80.22330 -2.016539 20 7.7 X4._09240311 X2.Quil 141.5 2024-03-11 07:00 - 08:30 -80.68232 -1.650939 4 1.5 X2._07240311 X4.Guasmo 141.0 2024-03-11 06:00 - 09:00 -80.25508 -2.035120 7 3.0 X4._06240311 X3.Pigio 140.5 2024-03-11 06:00 - 09:30 -80.66780 -1.834108 8 3.5 X3._06240311 X6.Daule 141.0 2024-03-11 05:30 - 09:00 -80.49417 -2.371927 8 3.5 X6._05240311 X2.Quil 157.0 2024-03-10 15:10 - 17:00 -80.68487 -1.648680 6 1.8 X2._15240310 X3.Pigio 156.5 2024-03-10 13:50 - 17:30 -80.66763 -1.834315 10 3.7 X3._13240310 X3.Pigio 160.3 2024-03-10 12:00 - 13:40 -80.66911 -1.833714 6 1.7 X3._12240310 X2.Quil 159.0 2024-03-10 11:10 - 15:00 -80.69294 -1.646549 15 3.8 X2._11240310 X4.Guasmo 162.0 2024-03-10 10:30 - 12:00 -80.29007 -2.053678 4 1.5 X4._10240310 X6.Daule 156.5 2024-03-10 10:00 - 17:30 -80.49413 -2.371238 16 7.5 X6._10240310 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
