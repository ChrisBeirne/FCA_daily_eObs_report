This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X4.Guasmo 15.0 2023-11-06 13:30 - 15:00 -80.12175 -2.047259 6 1.5 X4._13231106 X2.Quil 14.5 2023-11-06 13:10 - 15:31 -80.64795 -1.250855 7 2.3 X2._13231106 X4.Guasmo 20.0 2023-11-06 07:00 - 10:00 -80.11806 -2.081987 7 3.0 X4._07231106 X2.Quil 23.0 2023-11-06 05:30 - 07:00 -80.68829 -1.323646 4 1.5 X2._05231106 X4.Guasmo 37.0 2023-11-05 15:00 - 17:00 -80.11795 -2.081716 7 2.0 X4._15231105 X2.Quil 40.0 2023-11-05 09:30 - 14:00 -80.68718 -1.326263 12 4.5 X2._09231105 X4.Guasmo 43.5 2023-11-05 09:00 - 10:30 -80.14898 -2.038414 4 1.5 X4._09231105 X4.Guasmo 45.5 2023-11-05 05:30 - 08:30 -80.14913 -2.041523 7 3.0 X4._05231105 X2.Quil 45.0 2023-11-05 05:30 - 09:00 -80.68785 -1.325652 8 3.5 X2._05231105 X2.Quil 61.0 2023-11-04 15:00 - 17:00 -80.68787 -1.324831 5 2.0 X2._15231104 X2.Quil 63.5 2023-11-04 12:00 - 14:30 -80.68765 -1.325853 9 2.5 X2._12231104 X4.Guasmo 65.5 2023-11-04 09:00 - 12:30 -80.14727 -2.028922 8 3.5 X4._09231104 X4.Guasmo 69.5 2023-11-04 06:30 - 08:30 -80.14944 -2.029483 5 2.0 X4._06231104 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-11-04 05:10 - 09:00 -80.59577 -1.382962 10 3.8 X2._05231104 X3.Pigio 71.5 2023-11-04 05:00 - 06:30 -80.01603 -2.165466 4 1.5 X3._05231104 X3.Pigio 85.0 2023-11-03 15:00 - 17:00 -80.01611 -2.165386 7 2.0 X3._15231103 X4.Guasmo 85.0 2023-11-03 11:30 - 17:00 -80.14598 -2.028859 12 5.5 X4._11231103 X2.Quil 85.0 2023-11-03 10:40 - 17:00 -80.59544 -1.382905 20 6.3 X2._10231103 X3.Pigio 91.0 2023-11-03 09:20 - 11:00 -80.37962 -2.410071 6 1.7 X3._09231103 X4.Guasmo 91.0 2023-11-03 07:30 - 11:00 -80.14731 -2.028813 8 3.5 X4._07231103 X3.Pigio 94.0 2023-11-03 05:30 - 08:00 -80.49424 -2.453616 6 2.5 X3._05231103 X2.Quil 95.2 2023-11-03 05:30 - 06:50 -80.55414 -1.402389 5 1.3 X2._05231103 X4.Guasmo 95.0 2023-11-03 05:30 - 07:00 -80.14972 -2.029354 4 1.5 X4._05231103 X4.Guasmo 109.0 2023-11-02 12:30 - 17:00 -80.14973 -2.028471 10 4.5 X4._12231102 X2.Quil 112.5 2023-11-02 11:00 - 13:30 -80.59577 -1.382896 11 2.5 X2._11231102 X1.Guayas 116.0 2023-11-02 08:00 - 10:00 -80.17239 -2.158006 3 2.0 X1._08231102 X4.Guasmo 114.0 2023-11-02 07:30 - 12:00 -80.14952 -2.029618 14 4.5 X4._07231102 X2.Quil 118.5 2023-11-02 05:30 - 07:30 -80.60026 -1.475189 5 2.0 X2._05231102 X3.Pigio 116.5 2023-11-02 05:30 - 09:30 -80.48266 -2.459378 8 4.0 X3._05231102 X1.Guayas 119.0 2023-11-02 05:00 - 07:00 -80.17122 -2.157974 3 2.0 X1._05231102 X2.Quil 134.0 2023-11-01 14:30 - 16:00 -80.59999 -1.476059 4 1.5 X2._14231101 X3.Pigio 135.5 2023-11-01 13:10 - 14:30 -80.48603 -2.460634 5 1.3 X3._13231101 X2.Quil 136.0 2023-11-01 11:30 - 14:00 -80.59401 -1.470509 8 2.5 X2._11231101 X1.Guayas 135.0 2023-11-01 09:00 - 15:00 -80.17241 -2.158056 7 6.0 X1._09231101 X2.Quil 139.5 2023-11-01 05:30 - 10:30 -80.61179 -1.480957 13 5.0 X2._05231101 X3.Pigio 137.0 2023-11-01 05:30 - 13:00 -80.48485 -2.460939 16 7.5 X3._05231101 X4.Guasmo 142.0 2023-11-01 05:00 - 08:00 -80.14042 -2.037203 7 3.0 X4._05231101 X3.Pigio 157.0 2023-10-31 13:30 - 17:00 -80.48456 -2.461132 10 3.5 X3._13231031 X1.Guayas 158.0 2023-10-31 13:00 - 16:00 -80.17149 -2.157610 4 3.0 X1._13231031 X4.Guasmo 157.5 2023-10-31 10:30 - 16:30 -80.14386 -2.034930 13 6.0 X4._10231031 X2.Quil 157.0 2023-10-31 09:00 - 17:00 -80.61172 -1.480888 18 8.0 X2._09231031 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
