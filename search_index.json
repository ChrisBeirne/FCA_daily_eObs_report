This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 0.0 2023-10-22 12:20 - 14:00 -80.51008 -1.631778 7 1.7 X2._12231022 X2.Quil 4.0 2023-10-22 08:00 - 10:00 -80.44063 -1.643307 5 2.0 X2._08231022 X2.Quil 6.5 2023-10-22 05:30 - 07:30 -80.44174 -1.643230 5 2.0 X2._05231022 X2.Quil 21.5 2023-10-21 12:00 - 16:30 -80.43824 -1.641734 12 4.5 X2._12231021 X2.Quil 26.5 2023-10-21 09:00 - 11:30 -80.44112 -1.643020 8 2.5 X2._09231021 X2.Quil 29.2 2023-10-21 05:30 - 08:50 -80.44051 -1.643536 9 3.3 X2._05231021 X4.Guasmo 46.0 2023-10-20 06:30 - 16:00 -80.09163 -2.014808 20 9.5 X4._06231020 X2.Quil 45.0 2023-10-20 05:30 - 17:00 -80.44093 -1.643570 30 11.5 X2._05231020 X3.Pigio 53.5 2023-10-20 05:30 - 08:30 -80.56963 -1.584222 7 3.0 X3._05231020 X3.Pigio 72.0 2023-10-19 12:40 - 14:00 -80.56460 -1.602172 6 1.3 X3._12231019 X4.Guasmo 70.5 2023-10-19 06:30 - 15:30 -80.09154 -2.014621 19 9.0 X4._06231019 X3.Pigio 77.5 2023-10-19 05:30 - 08:30 -80.56912 -1.586268 7 3.0 X3._05231019 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-10-19 05:30 - 17:00 -80.44087 -1.643463 28 11.5 X2._05231019 X2.Quil 93.0 2023-10-18 13:00 - 17:00 -80.44152 -1.643991 9 4.0 X2._13231018 X1.Guayas 96.0 2023-10-18 12:30 - 14:00 -80.19069 -2.009094 4 1.5 X1._12231018 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-10-18 11:30 - 17:00 -80.56950 -1.586262 12 5.5 X3._11231018 X4.Guasmo 93.0 2023-10-18 10:30 - 17:00 -80.09469 -2.015554 16 6.5 X4._10231018 X3.Pigio 99.0 2023-10-18 06:20 - 11:00 -80.56978 -1.585265 15 4.7 X3._06231018 X2.Quil 101.0 2023-10-18 05:30 - 09:00 -80.53635 -1.926193 6 3.5 X2._05231018 X4.Guasmo 101.5 2023-10-18 05:30 - 08:30 -80.09156 -2.014986 7 3.0 X4._05231018 X2.Quil 117.0 2023-10-17 14:40 - 17:00 -80.53659 -1.926071 7 2.3 X2._14231017 X4.Guasmo 118.0 2023-10-17 14:30 - 16:00 -80.09257 -2.016105 4 1.5 X4._14231017 X1.Guayas 117.0 2023-10-17 13:00 - 17:00 -80.20180 -1.995786 9 4.0 X1._13231017 X4.Guasmo 120.0 2023-10-17 11:40 - 14:00 -80.09111 -2.016198 7 2.3 X4._11231017 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-10-17 11:30 - 17:00 -80.56969 -1.584896 14 5.5 X3._11231017 X2.Quil 119.5 2023-10-17 11:00 - 14:30 -80.54630 -1.912693 10 3.5 X2._11231017 X1.Guayas 125.0 2023-10-17 07:30 - 09:00 -80.25622 -2.011096 6 1.5 X1._07231017 X4.Guasmo 124.5 2023-10-17 06:00 - 09:30 -80.15102 -1.994480 10 3.5 X4._06231017 X2.Quil 124.5 2023-10-17 05:30 - 09:30 -80.54842 -1.913136 8 4.0 X2._05231017 X1.Guayas 127.0 2023-10-17 05:30 - 07:00 -80.25568 -2.012438 4 1.5 X1._05231017 X3.Pigio 126.5 2023-10-17 05:30 - 07:30 -80.55043 -1.567492 5 2.0 X3._05231017 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-10-16 15:30 - 17:00 -80.25611 -2.011069 8 1.5 X1._15231016 X2.Quil 141.0 2023-10-16 13:00 - 17:00 -80.54826 -1.912966 9 4.0 X2._13231016 X4.Guasmo 141.5 2023-10-16 13:00 - 16:30 -80.15205 -1.994115 8 3.5 X4._13231016 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-10-16 12:40 - 17:00 -80.55051 -1.567470 11 4.3 X3._12231016 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
