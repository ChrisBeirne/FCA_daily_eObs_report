This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 13.0 2023-10-16 12:40 - 17:00 -80.55051 -1.567470 11 4.3 X3._12231016 X1.Guayas 16.5 2023-10-16 11:30 - 13:30 -80.29041 -2.022454 4 2.0 X1._11231016 X3.Pigio 19.5 2023-10-16 09:00 - 10:30 -80.54077 -1.573068 4 1.5 X3._09231016 X3.Pigio 21.5 2023-10-16 06:30 - 08:30 -80.53997 -1.572487 5 2.0 X3._06231016 X3.Pigio 37.0 2023-10-15 15:30 - 17:00 -80.53995 -1.572681 4 1.5 X3._15231015 X3.Pigio 42.0 2023-10-15 09:00 - 12:00 -80.54390 -1.572721 7 3.0 X3._09231015 X3.Pigio 46.0 2023-10-15 05:30 - 08:00 -80.53680 -1.569292 6 2.5 X3._05231015 X3.Pigio 67.5 2023-10-14 08:30 - 10:30 -80.54403 -1.572751 5 2.0 X3._08231014 X3.Pigio 70.0 2023-10-14 05:30 - 08:00 -80.56923 -1.566292 6 2.5 X3._05231014 X3.Pigio 85.0 2023-10-13 15:30 - 17:00 -80.56947 -1.566176 4 1.5 X3._15231013 X3.Pigio 87.0 2023-10-13 13:30 - 15:00 -80.57033 -1.564996 4 1.5 X3._13231013 X2.Quil 88.0 2023-10-13 09:00 - 14:00 -80.65354 -1.870179 14 5.0 X2._09231013 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-10-13 07:30 - 09:00 -80.61871 -1.552365 4 1.5 X3._07231013 X2.Quil 93.5 2023-10-13 05:30 - 08:30 -80.65457 -1.870736 7 3.0 X2._05231013 X3.Pigio 110.0 2023-10-12 13:50 - 16:00 -80.62723 -1.550586 6 2.2 X3._13231012 X1.Guayas 112.0 2023-10-12 11:30 - 14:00 -80.08817 -2.143733 6 2.5 X1._11231012 X1.Guayas 116.0 2023-10-12 06:30 - 10:00 -80.08653 -2.142611 8 3.5 X1._06231012 X2.Quil 109.0 2023-10-12 05:30 - 17:00 -80.65371 -1.870524 27 11.5 X2._05231012 X3.Pigio 118.5 2023-10-12 05:30 - 07:30 -80.61875 -1.556055 5 2.0 X3._05231012 X2.Quil 133.0 2023-10-11 15:10 - 17:00 -80.65342 -1.870571 11 1.8 X2._15231011 X3.Pigio 133.5 2023-10-11 14:30 - 16:30 -80.61594 -1.553633 5 2.0 X3._14231011 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
