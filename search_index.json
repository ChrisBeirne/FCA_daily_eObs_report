This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X6.Daule 14.0 2024-03-14 13:30 - 16:00 -80.34886 -2.280846 8 2.5 X6._13240314 X2.Quil 16.0 2024-03-14 12:40 - 14:00 -80.51563 -1.632711 5 1.3 X2._12240314 X2.Quil 18.5 2024-03-14 09:50 - 11:30 -80.49488 -1.621123 7 1.7 X2._09240314 X2.Quil 21.0 2024-03-14 07:00 - 09:00 -80.57545 -1.554064 5 2.0 X2._07240314 X6.Daule 21.0 2024-03-14 05:30 - 09:00 -80.39534 -2.553319 8 3.5 X6._05240314 X2.Quil 36.5 2024-03-13 15:00 - 17:30 -80.57379 -1.556244 6 2.5 X2._15240313 X6.Daule 36.5 2024-03-13 13:30 - 17:30 -80.39552 -2.553405 11 4.0 X6._13240313 X2.Quil 39.5 2024-03-13 12:20 - 14:30 -80.57482 -1.554978 6 2.2 X2._12240313 X6.Daule 44.0 2024-03-13 05:30 - 10:00 -80.40215 -2.559489 12 4.5 X6._05240313 X2.Quil 60.5 2024-03-12 07:00 - 17:30 -80.67472 -1.575198 24 10.5 X2._07240312 X3.Pigio 69.5 2024-03-12 05:30 - 08:30 -80.64745 -1.818530 15 3.0 X3._05240312 X6.Daule 60.5 2024-03-12 05:30 - 17:30 -80.40214 -2.559342 27 12.0 X6._05240312 X3.Pigio 84.5 2024-03-11 13:20 - 17:30 -80.64740 -1.818218 13 4.2 X3._13240311 X6.Daule 84.5 2024-03-11 13:00 - 17:30 -80.40228 -2.559482 12 4.5 X6._13240311 X2.Quil 88.5 2024-03-11 11:30 - 13:30 -80.68285 -1.544395 7 2.0 X2._11240311 X2.Quil 93.5 2024-03-11 07:00 - 08:30 -80.68232 -1.650939 4 1.5 X2._07240311 X3.Pigio 92.5 2024-03-11 06:00 - 09:30 -80.66780 -1.834108 8 3.5 X3._06240311 X6.Daule 93.0 2024-03-11 05:30 - 09:00 -80.49417 -2.371927 8 3.5 X6._05240311 X2.Quil 109.0 2024-03-10 15:10 - 17:00 -80.68487 -1.648680 6 1.8 X2._15240310 X3.Pigio 108.5 2024-03-10 13:50 - 17:30 -80.66763 -1.834315 10 3.7 X3._13240310 X3.Pigio 112.3 2024-03-10 12:00 - 13:40 -80.66911 -1.833714 6 1.7 X3._12240310 X2.Quil 111.0 2024-03-10 11:10 - 15:00 -80.69294 -1.646549 15 3.8 X2._11240310 X4.Guasmo 114.0 2024-03-10 10:30 - 12:00 -80.29007 -2.053678 4 1.5 X4._10240310 X6.Daule 108.5 2024-03-10 08:30 - 17:30 -80.49413 -2.371238 19 9.0 X6._08240310 X2.Quil 116.5 2024-03-10 07:00 - 09:30 -80.53815 -1.660097 6 2.5 X2._07240310 X3.Pigio 118.5 2024-03-10 06:00 - 07:30 -80.68700 -1.801577 4 1.5 X3._06240310 X4.Guasmo 116.0 2024-03-10 05:30 - 10:00 -80.28749 -2.057649 10 4.5 X4._05240310 X3.Pigio 132.5 2024-03-09 16:00 - 17:30 -80.68637 -1.801907 4 1.5 X3._16240309 X2.Quil 132.5 2024-03-09 15:30 - 17:30 -80.53678 -1.659548 5 2.0 X2._15240309 X4.Guasmo 132.5 2024-03-09 15:30 - 17:30 -80.28730 -2.058281 5 2.0 X4._15240309 X6.Daule 132.5 2024-03-09 14:10 - 17:30 -80.49145 -2.368930 9 3.3 X6._14240309 X6.Daule 136.5 2024-03-09 11:20 - 13:30 -80.49061 -2.367052 6 2.2 X6._11240309 X2.Quil 140.5 2024-03-09 06:00 - 09:30 -80.67263 -1.527474 8 3.5 X2._06240309 X6.Daule 140.0 2024-03-09 05:30 - 10:00 -80.49888 -2.369852 12 4.5 X6._05240309 X4.Guasmo 141.0 2024-03-09 05:30 - 09:00 -80.07941 -2.127885 8 3.5 X4._05240309 X2.Quil 156.5 2024-03-08 16:00 - 17:30 -80.67265 -1.527497 4 1.5 X2._16240308 X4.Guasmo 156.5 2024-03-08 14:25 - 17:30 -80.07993 -2.128189 9 3.1 X4._14240308 X2.Quil 158.5 2024-03-08 11:30 - 15:30 -80.67230 -1.528834 9 4.0 X2._11240308 X2.Quil 162.7 2024-03-08 10:00 - 11:20 -80.67289 -1.528044 6 1.3 X2._10240308 X6.Daule 156.5 2024-03-08 10:00 - 17:30 -80.49888 -2.369227 18 7.5 X6._10240308 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
