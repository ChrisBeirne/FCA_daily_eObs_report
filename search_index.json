This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 12.5 2024-01-30 16:00 - 17:30 -80.67270 -1.492614 4 1.5 X2._16240130 X2.Quil 14.5 2024-01-30 13:30 - 15:30 -80.67194 -1.491413 5 2.0 X2._13240130 X6.Daule 12.5 2024-01-30 12:40 - 17:30 -80.28472 -2.422611 12 4.8 X6._12240130 X2.Quil 17.5 2024-01-30 11:00 - 12:30 -80.67190 -1.491629 4 1.5 X2._11240130 X2.Quil 19.5 2024-01-30 07:30 - 10:30 -80.67182 -1.488484 7 3.0 X2._07240130 X4.Guasmo 20.5 2024-01-30 06:30 - 09:30 -80.10264 -2.013976 9 3.0 X4._06240130 X6.Daule 22.0 2024-01-30 05:30 - 08:00 -80.48267 -2.283431 6 2.5 X6._05240130 X2.Quil 37.0 2024-01-29 15:30 - 17:00 -80.67224 -1.490794 4 1.5 X2._15240129 X6.Daule 36.5 2024-01-29 15:20 - 17:30 -80.48427 -2.282043 9 2.2 X6._15240129 X6.Daule 41.5 2024-01-29 10:30 - 12:30 -80.36333 -2.477286 5 2.0 X6._10240129 X4.Guasmo 37.5 2024-01-29 06:30 - 16:30 -80.10254 -2.014138 21 10.0 X4._06240129 X2.Quil 42.5 2024-01-29 06:00 - 11:30 -80.67574 -1.493205 12 5.5 X2._06240129 X6.Daule 46.0 2024-01-29 05:30 - 08:00 -80.37140 -2.481951 6 2.5 X6._05240129 X2.Quil 61.0 2024-01-28 14:50 - 17:00 -80.67575 -1.490887 7 2.2 X2._14240128 X6.Daule 62.0 2024-01-28 13:00 - 16:00 -80.37159 -2.482085 9 3.0 X6._13240128 X4.Guasmo 60.5 2024-01-28 12:30 - 17:30 -80.10271 -2.014180 13 5.0 X4._12240128 X2.Quil 64.0 2024-01-28 12:00 - 14:00 -80.73609 -1.497604 7 2.0 X2._12240128 X2.Quil 66.5 2024-01-28 09:30 - 11:30 -80.73292 -1.496771 7 2.0 X2._09240128 X2.Quil 69.0 2024-01-28 07:30 - 09:00 -80.73331 -1.497739 4 1.5 X2._07240128 X4.Guasmo 66.0 2024-01-28 06:30 - 12:00 -80.09776 -2.025594 12 5.5 X4._06240128 X6.Daule 69.0 2024-01-28 05:30 - 09:00 -80.29080 -2.425296 8 3.5 X6._05240128 X6.Daule 85.0 2024-01-27 15:40 - 17:00 -80.29140 -2.424969 5 1.3 X6._15240127 X4.Guasmo 85.5 2024-01-27 14:50 - 16:30 -80.09985 -2.027267 6 1.7 X4._14240127 X2.Quil 84.5 2024-01-27 13:00 - 17:30 -80.73440 -1.495842 10 4.5 X2._13240127 X4.Guasmo 87.5 2024-01-27 13:00 - 14:30 -80.10350 -2.029093 4 1.5 X4._13240127 X4.Guasmo 89.5 2024-01-27 11:00 - 12:30 -80.10523 -2.034421 6 1.5 X4._11240127 X2.Quil 91.5 2024-01-27 09:00 - 10:30 -80.69815 -1.490616 8 1.5 X2._09240127 X4.Guasmo 93.0 2024-01-27 05:30 - 09:00 -80.14966 -2.039560 10 3.5 X4._05240127 X4.Guasmo 108.5 2024-01-26 14:01 - 17:30 -80.14951 -2.038803 8 3.5 X4._14240126 X2.Quil 108.5 2024-01-26 13:50 - 17:30 -80.69902 -1.509354 9 3.7 X2._13240126 X4.Guasmo 112.5 2024-01-26 11:00 - 13:30 -80.15179 -2.037349 6 2.5 X4._11240126 X6.Daule 115.0 2024-01-26 09:00 - 11:00 -80.32914 -2.450397 5 2.0 X6._09240126 X2.Quil 117.0 2024-01-26 07:30 - 09:00 -80.69898 -1.509381 6 1.5 X2._07240126 X6.Daule 118.5 2024-01-26 05:30 - 07:30 -80.32793 -2.450684 5 2.0 X6._05240126 X2.Quil 132.3 2024-01-25 11:50 - 17:40 -80.69900 -1.509219 20 5.8 X2._11240125 X6.Daule 132.5 2024-01-25 11:00 - 17:30 -80.32808 -2.450781 14 6.5 X6._11240125 X3.Pigio 139.5 2024-01-25 08:30 - 10:30 -80.78934 -1.691823 5 2.0 X3._08240125 X2.Quil 141.5 2024-01-25 06:00 - 08:30 -80.66718 -1.353561 6 2.5 X2._06240125 X1.Guayas 142.0 2024-01-25 06:00 - 08:00 -80.11819 -2.150887 3 2.0 X1._06240125 X3.Pigio 142.0 2024-01-25 06:00 - 08:00 -80.78837 -1.692252 5 2.0 X3._06240125 X6.Daule 141.5 2024-01-25 05:30 - 08:30 -80.33998 -2.460914 9 3.0 X6._05240125 X6.Daule 156.5 2024-01-24 13:30 - 17:30 -80.33993 -2.460905 11 4.0 X6._13240124 X2.Quil 157.5 2024-01-24 12:50 - 16:30 -80.66651 -1.354253 16 3.7 X2._12240124 X1.Guayas 158.0 2024-01-24 12:00 - 16:00 -80.12328 -2.152473 5 4.0 X1._12240124 X4.Guasmo 161.0 2024-01-24 11:30 - 13:00 -80.14367 -2.006318 4 1.5 X4._11240124 X3.Pigio 156.5 2024-01-24 11:00 - 17:30 -80.78888 -1.692402 14 6.5 X3._11240124 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
