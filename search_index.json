This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 12.5 2023-11-10 15:00 - 17:00 -80.43865 -1.279268 5 2.0 X2._15231110 X2.Quil 18.0 2023-11-10 06:00 - 11:30 -80.43677 -1.278244 12 5.5 X2._06231110 X2.Quil 39.0 2023-11-09 13:00 - 14:30 -80.43535 -1.277875 4 1.5 X2._13231109 X2.Quil 41.0 2023-11-09 10:00 - 12:30 -80.43662 -1.277989 8 2.5 X2._10231109 X2.Quil 46.0 2023-11-09 05:30 - 07:30 -80.44126 -1.283244 4 2.0 X2._05231109 X2.Quil 60.5 2023-11-08 12:30 - 17:00 -80.44118 -1.282641 10 4.5 X2._12231108 X2.Quil 65.5 2023-11-08 09:11 - 12:00 -80.44144 -1.283336 8 2.8 X2._09231108 X2.Quil 70.0 2023-11-08 05:30 - 07:30 -80.47835 -1.270906 7 2.0 X2._05231108 X3.Pigio 70.5 2023-11-08 05:00 - 07:00 -80.20362 -2.016427 5 2.0 X3._05231108 X2.Quil 84.5 2023-11-07 14:40 - 17:00 -80.47856 -1.271041 7 2.3 X2._14231107 X3.Pigio 84.5 2023-11-07 13:30 - 17:00 -80.20390 -2.015480 8 3.5 X3._13231107 X2.Quil 87.0 2023-11-07 12:50 - 14:30 -80.48816 -1.261265 8 1.7 X2._12231107 X3.Pigio 91.0 2023-11-07 07:00 - 10:30 -80.08388 -1.995153 8 3.5 X3._07231107 X2.Quil 91.0 2023-11-07 05:30 - 10:30 -80.61055 -1.203685 11 5.0 X2._05231107 X4.Guasmo 85.0 2023-11-07 05:00 - 16:30 -80.12305 -2.049733 24 11.5 X4._05231107 X4.Guasmo 110.5 2023-11-06 13:30 - 15:00 -80.12175 -2.047259 6 1.5 X4._13231106 X3.Pigio 110.7 2023-11-06 13:20 - 14:50 -80.07896 -1.990606 7 1.5 X3._13231106 X2.Quil 110.0 2023-11-06 13:10 - 15:31 -80.64795 -1.250855 7 2.3 X2._13231106 X4.Guasmo 115.5 2023-11-06 07:00 - 10:00 -80.11806 -2.081987 7 3.0 X4._07231106 X1.Guayas 117.5 2023-11-06 06:00 - 08:00 -80.60161 -1.869667 3 2.0 X1._06231106 X2.Quil 118.5 2023-11-06 05:30 - 07:00 -80.68829 -1.323646 4 1.5 X2._05231106 X3.Pigio 116.5 2023-11-06 05:00 - 09:00 -80.11784 -2.081759 9 4.0 X3._05231106 X4.Guasmo 132.5 2023-11-05 15:00 - 17:00 -80.11795 -2.081716 7 2.0 X4._15231105 X3.Pigio 133.5 2023-11-05 14:20 - 16:00 -80.11768 -2.081627 6 1.7 X3._14231105 X1.Guayas 132.5 2023-11-05 13:00 - 17:00 -80.60136 -1.869294 5 4.0 X1._13231105 X3.Pigio 137.0 2023-11-05 11:00 - 12:30 -79.96515 -2.167062 6 1.5 X3._11231105 X2.Quil 135.5 2023-11-05 09:30 - 14:00 -80.68718 -1.326263 12 4.5 X2._09231105 X4.Guasmo 139.0 2023-11-05 09:00 - 10:30 -80.14898 -2.038414 4 1.5 X4._09231105 X3.Pigio 141.5 2023-11-05 06:30 - 08:00 -79.98677 -2.162479 4 1.5 X3._06231105 X4.Guasmo 141.0 2023-11-05 05:30 - 08:30 -80.14913 -2.041523 7 3.0 X4._05231105 X2.Quil 140.5 2023-11-05 05:30 - 09:00 -80.68785 -1.325652 8 3.5 X2._05231105 X2.Quil 156.5 2023-11-04 15:00 - 17:00 -80.68787 -1.324831 5 2.0 X2._15231104 X1.Guayas 158.5 2023-11-04 13:00 - 15:00 -80.54091 -1.858168 3 2.0 X1._13231104 X2.Quil 159.0 2023-11-04 12:00 - 14:30 -80.68765 -1.325853 9 2.5 X2._12231104 X4.Guasmo 161.0 2023-11-04 09:30 - 12:30 -80.14727 -2.028922 7 3.0 X4._09231104 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
