This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 6.5 2023-12-19 05:30 - 07:30 -80.64993 -1.580249 7 2.0 X3._05231219 X3.Pigio 22.5 2023-12-18 13:30 - 15:30 -80.65398 -1.593366 7 2.0 X3._13231218 X3.Pigio 25.0 2023-12-18 10:40 - 13:00 -80.65142 -1.597967 8 2.3 X3._10231218 X2.Quil 25.5 2023-12-18 10:30 - 12:30 -80.41256 -1.676872 5 2.0 X2._10231218 X3.Pigio 28.5 2023-12-18 05:30 - 09:30 -80.65455 -1.593067 9 4.0 X3._05231218 X2.Quil 30.0 2023-12-18 05:30 - 08:00 -80.40932 -1.674790 6 2.5 X2._05231218 X4.Guasmo 45.0 2023-12-17 15:30 - 17:01 -80.13128 -2.028105 4 1.5 X4._15231217 X2.Quil 44.7 2023-12-17 15:00 - 17:20 -80.41286 -1.677040 7 2.3 X2._15231217 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-12-17 14:00 - 17:00 -80.65471 -1.593113 9 3.0 X3._14231217 X2.Quil 47.5 2023-12-17 13:00 - 14:30 -80.40714 -1.676987 4 1.5 X2._13231217 X3.Pigio 48.5 2023-12-17 11:30 - 13:30 -80.65194 -1.595103 5 2.0 X3._11231217 X4.Guasmo 47.0 2023-12-17 10:00 - 15:00 -80.13335 -2.030659 10 5.0 X4._10231217 X2.Quil 53.0 2023-12-17 05:30 - 09:00 -80.40543 -1.680189 8 3.5 X2._05231217 X1.Guayas 48.0 2023-12-17 05:30 - 14:00 -80.34473 -1.997653 18 8.5 X1._05231217 X3.Pigio 52.5 2023-12-17 05:30 - 09:30 -80.67752 -1.589416 9 4.0 X3._05231217 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-12-16 15:30 - 17:00 -80.40540 -1.680077 4 1.5 X2._15231216 X4.Guasmo 69.0 2023-12-16 15:00 - 17:00 -80.12658 -2.027934 4 2.0 X4._15231216 X1.Guayas 69.0 2023-12-16 14:50 - 17:00 -80.34478 -1.997656 7 2.2 X1._14231216 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-12-16 14:40 - 17:00 -80.67752 -1.589436 7 2.3 X3._14231216 X4.Guasmo 71.5 2023-12-16 12:00 - 14:30 -80.12497 -2.019648 6 2.5 X4._12231216 X4.Guasmo 77.0 2023-12-16 07:00 - 09:00 -80.13349 -1.994139 3 2.0 X4._07231216 X3.Pigio 77.5 2023-12-16 07:00 - 08:30 -80.70234 -1.509630 4 1.5 X3._07231216 X2.Quil 76.0 2023-12-16 06:30 - 10:00 -80.40075 -1.661176 8 3.5 X2._06231216 X1.Guayas 75.0 2023-12-16 06:00 - 11:00 -80.71450 -1.379979 6 5.0 X1._06231216 X2.Quil 93.0 2023-12-15 15:30 - 17:00 -80.40010 -1.662131 4 1.5 X2._15231215 X2.Quil 95.0 2023-12-15 13:00 - 15:00 -80.40081 -1.660629 5 2.0 X2._13231215 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-12-15 12:00 - 17:00 -80.70300 -1.507593 12 5.0 X3._12231215 X1.Guayas 93.0 2023-12-15 11:00 - 17:00 -80.71465 -1.379789 7 6.0 X1._11231215 X4.Guasmo 101.0 2023-12-15 06:00 - 09:00 -80.12097 -1.999226 4 3.0 X4._06231215 X1.Guayas 102.0 2023-12-15 06:00 - 08:00 -80.69141 -1.317598 3 2.0 X1._06231215 X3.Pigio 102.0 2023-12-15 05:30 - 08:00 -80.69508 -1.701701 5 2.5 X3._05231215 X3.Pigio 117.5 2023-12-14 14:30 - 16:30 -80.69592 -1.700952 7 2.0 X3._14231214 X4.Guasmo 117.0 2023-12-14 11:01 - 17:00 -80.12114 -1.999295 7 6.0 X4._11231214 X3.Pigio 122.0 2023-12-14 10:30 - 12:00 -80.69241 -1.719489 4 1.5 X3._10231214 X2.Quil 121.5 2023-12-14 10:00 - 12:30 -80.44562 -1.646760 8 2.5 X2._10231214 X1.Guayas 117.0 2023-12-14 06:00 - 17:00 -80.69137 -1.317642 12 11.0 X1._06231214 X3.Pigio 125.5 2023-12-14 05:30 - 08:30 -80.69087 -1.720596 7 3.0 X3._05231214 X2.Quil 126.5 2023-12-14 05:30 - 07:30 -80.44549 -1.641644 5 2.0 X2._05231214 X4.Guasmo 141.0 2023-12-13 15:30 - 17:00 -80.11427 -2.005571 4 1.5 X4._15231213 X2.Quil 141.0 2023-12-13 13:30 - 17:00 -80.44582 -1.641818 9 3.5 X2._13231213 X4.Guasmo 143.0 2023-12-13 13:20 - 15:00 -80.11543 -1.999664 6 1.7 X4._13231213 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-12-13 13:00 - 17:00 -80.69136 -1.317659 5 4.0 X1._13231213 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-12-13 11:40 - 17:00 -80.69066 -1.720960 17 5.3 X3._11231213 X2.Quil 145.0 2023-12-13 10:00 - 13:00 -80.44573 -1.640729 11 3.0 X2._10231213 X1.Guayas 147.0 2023-12-13 09:00 - 11:00 -80.70762 -1.429244 3 2.0 X1._09231213 X3.Pigio 147.5 2023-12-13 08:00 - 10:30 -80.76148 -1.636024 6 2.5 X3._08231213 X4.Guasmo 149.0 2023-12-13 07:00 - 09:00 -80.11526 -2.006576 3 2.0 X4._07231213 X1.Guayas 150.0 2023-12-13 06:00 - 08:00 -80.70894 -1.430037 3 2.0 X1._06231213 X2.Quil 150.0 2023-12-13 05:30 - 08:00 -80.64200 -1.648476 8 2.5 X2._05231213 X3.Pigio 150.5 2023-12-13 05:30 - 07:30 -80.76262 -1.635670 5 2.0 X3._05231213 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
