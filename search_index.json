This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X4.Guasmo 5.0 2023-11-20 07:30 - 09:00 -80.15418 -1.992462 4 1.5 X4._07231120 X4.Guasmo 7.0 2023-11-20 05:30 - 07:00 -80.15538 -1.992684 4 1.5 X4._05231120 X3.Pigio 21.0 2023-11-19 15:30 - 17:00 -80.46330 -1.512107 4 1.5 X3._15231119 X4.Guasmo 21.5 2023-11-19 15:00 - 16:30 -80.15307 -1.992382 4 1.5 X4._15231119 X3.Pigio 23.0 2023-11-19 10:30 - 15:00 -80.46285 -1.512342 10 4.5 X3._10231119 X3.Pigio 28.0 2023-11-19 06:30 - 10:00 -80.46401 -1.510610 10 3.5 X3._06231119 X4.Guasmo 29.0 2023-11-19 05:30 - 09:00 -80.09784 -1.986044 8 3.5 X4._05231119 X3.Pigio 46.0 2023-11-18 12:30 - 16:00 -80.46255 -1.509052 8 3.5 X3._12231118 X3.Pigio 50.0 2023-11-18 10:30 - 12:00 -80.46352 -1.510240 6 1.5 X3._10231118 X2.Quil 52.2 2023-11-18 08:00 - 09:50 -80.46609 -1.882160 5 1.8 X2._08231118 X3.Pigio 52.0 2023-11-18 07:00 - 10:00 -80.46497 -1.509978 7 3.0 X3._07231118 X4.Guasmo 51.0 2023-11-18 05:30 - 11:00 -80.09753 -1.986419 16 5.5 X4._05231118 X4.Guasmo 69.0 2023-11-17 14:00 - 17:00 -80.09776 -1.986173 9 3.0 X4._14231117 X2.Quil 70.0 2023-11-17 13:40 - 16:00 -80.46134 -1.882199 6 2.3 X2._13231117 X3.Pigio 70.0 2023-11-17 12:00 - 16:00 -80.46721 -1.510911 9 4.0 X3._12231117 X3.Pigio 76.0 2023-11-17 08:00 - 10:00 -80.47007 -1.512678 5 2.0 X3._08231117 X2.Quil 78.0 2023-11-17 06:30 - 08:00 -80.56583 -1.683500 4 1.5 X2._06231117 X4.Guasmo 78.0 2023-11-17 06:00 - 08:00 -80.13442 -2.036187 5 2.0 X4._06231117 X3.Pigio 78.5 2023-11-17 05:30 - 07:30 -80.46730 -1.537578 5 2.0 X3._05231117 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-11-16 13:30 - 17:00 -80.46752 -1.537550 10 3.5 X3._13231116 X4.Guasmo 95.5 2023-11-16 13:10 - 14:30 -80.13256 -2.044405 4 1.3 X4._13231116 X4.Guasmo 98.0 2023-11-16 10:30 - 12:00 -80.13064 -2.051031 4 1.5 X4._10231116 X1.Guayas 99.0 2023-11-16 09:00 - 11:00 -80.64927 -1.604599 3 2.0 X1._09231116 X3.Pigio 99.0 2023-11-16 08:00 - 11:00 -80.48347 -1.546277 8 3.0 X3._08231116 X1.Guayas 102.0 2023-11-16 06:00 - 08:00 -80.64879 -1.604418 3 2.0 X1._06231116 X3.Pigio 102.7 2023-11-16 05:30 - 07:20 -80.48677 -1.550119 7 1.8 X3._05231116 X2.Quil 101.0 2023-11-16 05:30 - 09:00 -80.51993 -1.637989 8 3.5 X2._05231116 X4.Guasmo 101.0 2023-11-16 05:30 - 09:00 -80.12697 -2.049524 8 3.5 X4._05231116 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-11-15 15:01 - 17:00 -80.48666 -1.550124 7 2.0 X3._15231115 X2.Quil 118.0 2023-11-15 12:30 - 16:00 -80.52038 -1.637748 8 3.5 X2._12231115 X4.Guasmo 118.5 2023-11-15 12:00 - 15:30 -80.12808 -2.047670 9 3.5 X4._12231115 X3.Pigio 121.5 2023-11-15 10:40 - 12:30 -80.47434 -1.550329 6 1.8 X3._10231115 X2.Quil 122.0 2023-11-15 10:30 - 12:00 -80.52114 -1.637842 4 1.5 X2._10231115 X4.Guasmo 123.0 2023-11-15 09:30 - 11:00 -80.12181 -2.063162 4 1.5 X4._09231115 X1.Guayas 121.0 2023-11-15 08:00 - 13:00 -80.57617 -1.657612 6 5.0 X1._08231115 X4.Guasmo 125.0 2023-11-15 06:30 - 09:00 -80.12089 -2.063409 6 2.5 X4._06231115 X2.Quil 124.0 2023-11-15 05:30 - 10:00 -80.52163 -1.635191 11 4.5 X2._05231115 X3.Pigio 125.5 2023-11-15 05:30 - 08:30 -80.43352 -1.657559 7 3.0 X3._05231115 X2.Quil 142.0 2023-11-14 14:00 - 16:00 -80.52132 -1.632947 5 2.0 X2._14231114 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-11-14 13:00 - 17:00 -80.57301 -1.657879 5 4.0 X1._13231114 X4.Guasmo 141.0 2023-11-14 12:00 - 17:00 -80.12134 -2.063721 13 5.0 X4._12231114 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-11-14 10:00 - 17:00 -80.43300 -1.657316 23 7.0 X3._10231114 X2.Quil 145.5 2023-11-14 09:00 - 12:30 -80.52161 -1.630786 8 3.5 X2._09231114 X2.Quil 149.5 2023-11-14 07:00 - 08:30 -80.52522 -1.634638 3 1.5 X2._07231114 X4.Guasmo 147.0 2023-11-14 06:30 - 11:00 -80.15725 -1.996475 17 4.5 X4._06231114 X1.Guayas 150.0 2023-11-14 06:00 - 08:00 -80.52089 -1.636562 3 2.0 X1._06231114 X3.Pigio 150.0 2023-11-14 05:30 - 08:00 -80.40880 -1.832794 6 2.5 X3._05231114 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
