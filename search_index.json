This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 0.0 2023-12-21 12:30 - 14:00 -80.09124 -2.153723 4 1.5 X2._12231221 X2.Quil 2.0 2023-12-21 10:30 - 12:00 -80.08628 -2.145421 5 1.5 X2._10231221 X2.Quil 5.0 2023-12-21 06:00 - 09:00 -80.05487 -2.067023 7 3.0 X2._06231221 X1.Guayas 4.5 2023-12-21 05:30 - 09:30 -80.29858 -2.134705 9 4.0 X1._05231221 X1.Guayas 21.0 2023-12-20 15:40 - 17:00 -80.29870 -2.134854 5 1.3 X1._15231220 X2.Quil 21.0 2023-12-20 15:00 - 17:00 -80.05223 -2.069639 5 2.0 X2._15231220 X1.Guayas 23.0 2023-12-20 09:50 - 15:00 -80.29853 -2.127346 13 5.2 X1._09231220 X1.Guayas 28.5 2023-12-20 08:00 - 09:30 -80.30389 -2.128963 4 1.5 X1._08231220 X1.Guayas 30.5 2023-12-20 06:00 - 07:30 -80.30172 -2.124898 4 1.5 X1._06231220 X3.Pigio 28.5 2023-12-20 05:30 - 09:30 -80.65695 -1.430996 9 4.0 X3._05231220 X1.Guayas 46.0 2023-12-19 14:30 - 16:00 -80.30155 -2.131223 6 1.5 X1._14231219 X3.Pigio 45.5 2023-12-19 12:10 - 16:30 -80.65740 -1.431429 12 4.3 X3._12231219 X1.Guayas 52.0 2023-12-19 06:00 - 10:00 -80.32145 -1.989907 5 4.0 X1._06231219 X3.Pigio 54.5 2023-12-19 05:30 - 07:30 -80.64993 -1.580249 7 2.0 X3._05231219 X2.Quil 54.0 2023-12-19 05:30 - 08:00 -80.41254 -1.676718 6 2.5 X2._05231219 X1.Guayas 69.0 2023-12-18 14:00 - 17:00 -80.32049 -1.988804 5 3.0 X1._14231218 X3.Pigio 70.5 2023-12-18 13:30 - 15:30 -80.65398 -1.593366 7 2.0 X3._13231218 X3.Pigio 73.0 2023-12-18 10:40 - 13:00 -80.65142 -1.597967 8 2.3 X3._10231218 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-12-18 10:30 - 17:00 -80.41268 -1.677216 19 6.5 X2._10231218 X1.Guayas 73.0 2023-12-18 10:00 - 13:00 -80.32072 -1.992438 5 3.0 X1._10231218 X1.Guayas 78.0 2023-12-18 06:00 - 08:00 -80.34385 -1.996928 3 2.0 X1._06231218 X3.Pigio 76.5 2023-12-18 05:30 - 09:30 -80.65455 -1.593067 9 4.0 X3._05231218 X2.Quil 78.0 2023-12-18 05:30 - 08:00 -80.40932 -1.674790 6 2.5 X2._05231218 X4.Guasmo 93.0 2023-12-17 15:30 - 17:01 -80.13128 -2.028105 4 1.5 X4._15231217 X2.Quil 92.7 2023-12-17 15:00 - 17:20 -80.41286 -1.677040 7 2.3 X2._15231217 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-12-17 14:00 - 17:00 -80.65471 -1.593113 9 3.0 X3._14231217 X2.Quil 95.5 2023-12-17 13:00 - 14:30 -80.40714 -1.676987 4 1.5 X2._13231217 X3.Pigio 96.5 2023-12-17 11:30 - 13:30 -80.65194 -1.595103 5 2.0 X3._11231217 X4.Guasmo 95.0 2023-12-17 10:00 - 15:00 -80.13335 -2.030659 10 5.0 X4._10231217 X2.Quil 101.0 2023-12-17 05:30 - 09:00 -80.40543 -1.680189 8 3.5 X2._05231217 X1.Guayas 95.0 2023-12-17 05:30 - 15:00 -80.34479 -1.997693 20 9.5 X1._05231217 X3.Pigio 100.5 2023-12-17 05:30 - 09:30 -80.67752 -1.589416 9 4.0 X3._05231217 X2.Quil 117.0 2023-12-16 15:30 - 17:00 -80.40540 -1.680077 4 1.5 X2._15231216 X4.Guasmo 117.0 2023-12-16 15:00 - 17:00 -80.12658 -2.027934 4 2.0 X4._15231216 X1.Guayas 117.0 2023-12-16 14:50 - 17:00 -80.34478 -1.997656 7 2.2 X1._14231216 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-12-16 14:40 - 17:00 -80.67752 -1.589436 7 2.3 X3._14231216 X4.Guasmo 119.5 2023-12-16 12:00 - 14:30 -80.12497 -2.019648 6 2.5 X4._12231216 X4.Guasmo 125.0 2023-12-16 07:00 - 09:00 -80.13349 -1.994139 3 2.0 X4._07231216 X3.Pigio 125.5 2023-12-16 07:00 - 08:30 -80.70234 -1.509630 4 1.5 X3._07231216 X2.Quil 124.0 2023-12-16 06:30 - 10:00 -80.40075 -1.661176 8 3.5 X2._06231216 X1.Guayas 123.0 2023-12-16 06:00 - 11:00 -80.71450 -1.379979 6 5.0 X1._06231216 X2.Quil 141.0 2023-12-15 15:30 - 17:00 -80.40010 -1.662131 4 1.5 X2._15231215 X2.Quil 143.0 2023-12-15 13:00 - 15:00 -80.40081 -1.660629 5 2.0 X2._13231215 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-12-15 12:00 - 17:00 -80.70300 -1.507593 12 5.0 X3._12231215 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-12-15 11:00 - 17:00 -80.71465 -1.379789 7 6.0 X1._11231215 X4.Guasmo 149.0 2023-12-15 06:00 - 09:00 -80.12097 -1.999226 4 3.0 X4._06231215 X1.Guayas 150.0 2023-12-15 06:00 - 08:00 -80.69141 -1.317598 3 2.0 X1._06231215 X3.Pigio 150.0 2023-12-15 05:30 - 08:00 -80.69508 -1.701701 5 2.5 X3._05231215 X1.Guayas 165.0 2023-12-14 15:00 - 17:00 -80.69137 -1.317642 3 2.0 X1._15231214 X4.Guasmo 165.0 2023-12-14 15:00 - 17:00 -80.12114 -1.999295 3 2.0 X4._15231214 X3.Pigio 165.5 2023-12-14 15:00 - 16:30 -80.69592 -1.700952 6 1.5 X3._15231214 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
