This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X4.Guasmo 18.0 2024-03-10 10:30 - 12:00 -80.29007 -2.053678 4 1.5 X4._10240310 X6.Daule 12.5 2024-03-10 08:30 - 17:30 -80.49413 -2.371238 19 9.0 X6._08240310 X4.Guasmo 20.0 2024-03-10 05:30 - 10:00 -80.28749 -2.057649 10 4.5 X4._05240310 X4.Guasmo 36.5 2024-03-09 15:30 - 17:30 -80.28730 -2.058281 5 2.0 X4._15240309 X6.Daule 36.5 2024-03-09 14:10 - 17:30 -80.49145 -2.368930 9 3.3 X6._14240309 X6.Daule 40.5 2024-03-09 11:20 - 13:30 -80.49061 -2.367052 6 2.2 X6._11240309 X6.Daule 44.0 2024-03-09 05:30 - 10:00 -80.49888 -2.369852 12 4.5 X6._05240309 X4.Guasmo 45.0 2024-03-09 05:30 - 09:00 -80.07941 -2.127885 8 3.5 X4._05240309 X2.Quil 60.5 2024-03-08 16:00 - 17:30 -80.67265 -1.527497 4 1.5 X2._16240308 X4.Guasmo 60.5 2024-03-08 14:25 - 17:30 -80.07993 -2.128189 9 3.1 X4._14240308 X2.Quil 62.5 2024-03-08 11:30 - 15:30 -80.67230 -1.528834 9 4.0 X2._11240308 X2.Quil 66.7 2024-03-08 06:00 - 11:20 -80.67289 -1.528044 19 5.3 X2._06240308 X4.Guasmo 68.5 2024-03-08 05:30 - 09:30 -80.04486 -2.093084 9 4.0 X4._05240308 X6.Daule 60.5 2024-03-08 05:30 - 17:30 -80.49888 -2.369227 27 12.0 X6._05240308 X4.Guasmo 86.0 2024-03-07 14:30 - 16:00 -80.04381 -2.094603 4 1.5 X4._14240307 X2.Quil 86.2 2024-03-07 13:30 - 15:50 -80.67741 -1.552115 7 2.3 X2._13240307 X4.Guasmo 88.0 2024-03-07 10:10 - 14:00 -80.04469 -2.096817 10 3.8 X4._10240307 X3.Pigio 89.8 2024-03-07 10:00 - 12:10 -80.63038 -1.800765 5 2.2 X3._10240307 X4.Guasmo 94.0 2024-03-07 06:00 - 08:00 -80.05143 -2.105593 5 2.0 X4._06240307 X2.Quil 93.5 2024-03-07 06:00 - 08:30 -80.67918 -1.530280 6 2.5 X2._06240307 X3.Pigio 93.0 2024-03-07 06:00 - 09:00 -80.65042 -1.797086 7 3.0 X3._06240307 X6.Daule 84.5 2024-03-07 05:30 - 17:30 -80.49874 -2.369768 25 12.0 X6._05240307 X3.Pigio 109.0 2024-03-06 15:10 - 17:00 -80.65128 -1.798635 6 1.8 X3._15240306 X6.Daule 108.5 2024-03-06 14:10 - 17:30 -80.49873 -2.369494 8 3.3 X6._14240306 X2.Quil 109.5 2024-03-06 12:30 - 16:30 -80.68179 -1.535687 9 4.0 X2._12240306 X6.Daule 112.5 2024-03-06 12:00 - 13:30 -80.50168 -2.364266 4 1.5 X6._12240306 X4.Guasmo 113.0 2024-03-06 09:00 - 13:00 -80.05802 -2.078009 9 4.0 X4._09240306 X6.Daule 115.0 2024-03-06 08:30 - 11:00 -80.50155 -2.360324 8 2.5 X6._08240306 X4.Guasmo 117.5 2024-03-06 06:30 - 08:30 -80.05842 -2.077105 5 2.0 X4._06240306 X3.Pigio 114.5 2024-03-06 06:00 - 11:30 -80.67708 -1.863477 12 5.5 X3._06240306 X6.Daule 118.5 2024-03-06 06:00 - 07:30 -80.50459 -2.359807 4 1.5 X6._06240306 X2.Quil 118.5 2024-03-06 05:51 - 07:31 -80.66263 -1.562453 5 1.7 X2._05240306 X4.Guasmo 132.5 2024-03-05 16:00 - 17:30 -80.05824 -2.078111 4 1.5 X4._16240305 X2.Quil 132.5 2024-03-05 15:00 - 17:30 -80.66247 -1.562186 6 2.5 X2._15240305 X3.Pigio 134.0 2024-03-05 12:50 - 16:00 -80.67432 -1.864372 9 3.2 X3._12240305 X4.Guasmo 134.5 2024-03-05 11:00 - 15:30 -80.06220 -2.073103 10 4.5 X4._11240305 X6.Daule 132.5 2024-03-05 09:00 - 17:30 -80.50461 -2.359634 18 8.5 X6._09240305 X3.Pigio 141.0 2024-03-05 06:30 - 09:00 -80.52727 -1.910272 8 2.5 X3._06240305 X2.Quil 135.5 2024-03-05 06:00 - 14:30 -80.65438 -1.566747 18 8.5 X2._06240305 X4.Guasmo 140.0 2024-03-05 05:30 - 10:00 -80.06062 -2.075254 11 4.5 X4._05240305 X4.Guasmo 156.5 2024-03-04 16:00 - 17:31 -80.06082 -2.075588 4 1.5 X4._16240304 X2.Quil 156.5 2024-03-04 14:00 - 17:30 -80.65454 -1.566594 8 3.5 X2._14240304 X4.Guasmo 158.5 2024-03-04 14:00 - 15:30 -80.06335 -2.072894 4 1.5 X4._14240304 X3.Pigio 156.5 2024-03-04 14:00 - 17:30 -80.52748 -1.910257 8 3.5 X3._14240304 X6.Daule 156.5 2024-03-04 14:00 - 17:30 -80.50260 -2.362153 8 3.5 X6._14240304 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
