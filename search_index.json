This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X4.Guasmo 16.0 2023-11-23 11:30 - 14:00 -80.15258 -1.989403 5 2.5 X4._11231123 X3.Pigio 22.0 2023-11-23 05:30 - 08:00 -80.68507 -1.439075 6 2.5 X3._05231123 X3.Pigio 37.0 2023-11-22 07:50 - 17:00 -80.68457 -1.438915 29 9.2 X3._07231122 X4.Guasmo 62.5 2023-11-21 14:00 - 15:30 -80.11822 -2.081707 4 1.5 X4._14231121 X4.Guasmo 69.5 2023-11-21 07:00 - 08:30 -80.13059 -1.983757 6 1.5 X4._07231121 X3.Pigio 85.0 2023-11-20 15:00 - 17:00 -80.48474 -1.466721 7 2.0 X3._15231120 X4.Guasmo 85.0 2023-11-20 14:10 - 17:00 -80.13017 -1.983709 8 2.8 X4._14231120 X3.Pigio 87.5 2023-11-20 13:10 - 14:30 -80.48430 -1.467651 5 1.3 X3._13231120 X2.Quil 86.0 2023-11-20 12:40 - 16:00 -80.55548 -1.920277 15 3.3 X2._12231120 X4.Guasmo 93.0 2023-11-20 07:30 - 09:00 -80.15418 -1.992462 4 1.5 X4._07231120 X2.Quil 93.5 2023-11-20 05:30 - 08:30 -80.39222 -2.018104 9 3.0 X2._05231120 X4.Guasmo 95.0 2023-11-20 05:30 - 07:00 -80.15538 -1.992684 4 1.5 X4._05231120 X3.Pigio 109.0 2023-11-19 15:30 - 17:00 -80.46330 -1.512107 4 1.5 X3._15231119 X4.Guasmo 109.5 2023-11-19 15:00 - 16:30 -80.15307 -1.992382 4 1.5 X4._15231119 X2.Quil 109.0 2023-11-19 14:00 - 17:00 -80.39100 -2.017762 7 3.0 X2._14231119 X3.Pigio 111.0 2023-11-19 10:30 - 15:00 -80.46285 -1.512342 10 4.5 X3._10231119 X2.Quil 114.5 2023-11-19 10:10 - 11:30 -80.22113 -2.137301 5 1.3 X2._10231119 X3.Pigio 116.0 2023-11-19 06:30 - 10:00 -80.46401 -1.510610 10 3.5 X3._06231119 X4.Guasmo 117.0 2023-11-19 05:30 - 09:00 -80.09784 -1.986044 8 3.5 X4._05231119 X2.Quil 118.5 2023-11-19 05:30 - 07:30 -80.29024 -2.068095 5 2.0 X2._05231119 X2.Quil 134.5 2023-11-18 13:50 - 15:30 -80.29519 -2.065421 5 1.7 X2._13231118 X3.Pigio 134.0 2023-11-18 12:30 - 16:00 -80.46255 -1.509052 8 3.5 X3._12231118 X3.Pigio 138.0 2023-11-18 10:30 - 12:00 -80.46352 -1.510240 6 1.5 X3._10231118 X2.Quil 140.2 2023-11-18 08:00 - 09:50 -80.46609 -1.882160 5 1.8 X2._08231118 X3.Pigio 140.0 2023-11-18 07:00 - 10:00 -80.46497 -1.509978 7 3.0 X3._07231118 X4.Guasmo 139.0 2023-11-18 05:30 - 11:00 -80.09753 -1.986419 16 5.5 X4._05231118 X4.Guasmo 157.0 2023-11-17 14:00 - 17:00 -80.09776 -1.986173 9 3.0 X4._14231117 X2.Quil 158.0 2023-11-17 13:40 - 16:00 -80.46134 -1.882199 6 2.3 X2._13231117 X3.Pigio 158.0 2023-11-17 12:00 - 16:00 -80.46721 -1.510911 9 4.0 X3._12231117 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
