This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 0.0 2024-03-13 12:20 - 14:00 -80.57481 -1.554959 5 1.7 X2._12240313 X6.Daule 4.0 2024-03-13 05:30 - 10:00 -80.40215 -2.559489 12 4.5 X6._05240313 X2.Quil 20.5 2024-03-12 07:00 - 17:30 -80.67472 -1.575198 24 10.5 X2._07240312 X3.Pigio 29.5 2024-03-12 05:30 - 08:30 -80.64745 -1.818530 15 3.0 X3._05240312 X6.Daule 20.5 2024-03-12 05:30 - 17:30 -80.40214 -2.559342 27 12.0 X6._05240312 X3.Pigio 44.5 2024-03-11 13:20 - 17:30 -80.64740 -1.818218 13 4.2 X3._13240311 X6.Daule 44.5 2024-03-11 13:00 - 17:30 -80.40228 -2.559482 12 4.5 X6._13240311 X2.Quil 48.5 2024-03-11 11:30 - 13:30 -80.68285 -1.544395 7 2.0 X2._11240311 X2.Quil 53.5 2024-03-11 07:00 - 08:30 -80.68232 -1.650939 4 1.5 X2._07240311 X3.Pigio 52.5 2024-03-11 06:00 - 09:30 -80.66780 -1.834108 8 3.5 X3._06240311 X6.Daule 53.0 2024-03-11 05:30 - 09:00 -80.49417 -2.371927 8 3.5 X6._05240311 X2.Quil 69.0 2024-03-10 15:10 - 17:00 -80.68487 -1.648680 6 1.8 X2._15240310 X3.Pigio 68.5 2024-03-10 13:50 - 17:30 -80.66763 -1.834315 10 3.7 X3._13240310 X3.Pigio 72.3 2024-03-10 12:00 - 13:40 -80.66911 -1.833714 6 1.7 X3._12240310 X2.Quil 71.0 2024-03-10 11:10 - 15:00 -80.69294 -1.646549 15 3.8 X2._11240310 X4.Guasmo 74.0 2024-03-10 10:30 - 12:00 -80.29007 -2.053678 4 1.5 X4._10240310 X6.Daule 68.5 2024-03-10 08:30 - 17:30 -80.49413 -2.371238 19 9.0 X6._08240310 X2.Quil 76.5 2024-03-10 07:00 - 09:30 -80.53815 -1.660097 6 2.5 X2._07240310 X3.Pigio 78.5 2024-03-10 06:00 - 07:30 -80.68700 -1.801577 4 1.5 X3._06240310 X4.Guasmo 76.0 2024-03-10 05:30 - 10:00 -80.28749 -2.057649 10 4.5 X4._05240310 X3.Pigio 92.5 2024-03-09 16:00 - 17:30 -80.68637 -1.801907 4 1.5 X3._16240309 X2.Quil 92.5 2024-03-09 15:30 - 17:30 -80.53678 -1.659548 5 2.0 X2._15240309 X4.Guasmo 92.5 2024-03-09 15:30 - 17:30 -80.28730 -2.058281 5 2.0 X4._15240309 X6.Daule 92.5 2024-03-09 14:10 - 17:30 -80.49145 -2.368930 9 3.3 X6._14240309 X6.Daule 96.5 2024-03-09 11:20 - 13:30 -80.49061 -2.367052 6 2.2 X6._11240309 X2.Quil 100.5 2024-03-09 06:00 - 09:30 -80.67263 -1.527474 8 3.5 X2._06240309 X6.Daule 100.0 2024-03-09 05:30 - 10:00 -80.49888 -2.369852 12 4.5 X6._05240309 X4.Guasmo 101.0 2024-03-09 05:30 - 09:00 -80.07941 -2.127885 8 3.5 X4._05240309 X2.Quil 116.5 2024-03-08 16:00 - 17:30 -80.67265 -1.527497 4 1.5 X2._16240308 X4.Guasmo 116.5 2024-03-08 14:25 - 17:30 -80.07993 -2.128189 9 3.1 X4._14240308 X2.Quil 118.5 2024-03-08 11:30 - 15:30 -80.67230 -1.528834 9 4.0 X2._11240308 X2.Quil 122.7 2024-03-08 06:00 - 11:20 -80.67289 -1.528044 19 5.3 X2._06240308 X4.Guasmo 124.5 2024-03-08 05:30 - 09:30 -80.04486 -2.093084 9 4.0 X4._05240308 X6.Daule 116.5 2024-03-08 05:30 - 17:30 -80.49888 -2.369227 27 12.0 X6._05240308 X4.Guasmo 142.0 2024-03-07 14:30 - 16:00 -80.04381 -2.094603 4 1.5 X4._14240307 X2.Quil 142.2 2024-03-07 13:30 - 15:50 -80.67741 -1.552115 7 2.3 X2._13240307 X4.Guasmo 144.0 2024-03-07 10:10 - 14:00 -80.04469 -2.096817 10 3.8 X4._10240307 X3.Pigio 145.8 2024-03-07 10:00 - 12:10 -80.63038 -1.800765 5 2.2 X3._10240307 X4.Guasmo 150.0 2024-03-07 06:00 - 08:00 -80.05143 -2.105593 5 2.0 X4._06240307 X2.Quil 149.5 2024-03-07 06:00 - 08:30 -80.67918 -1.530280 6 2.5 X2._06240307 X3.Pigio 149.0 2024-03-07 06:00 - 09:00 -80.65042 -1.797086 7 3.0 X3._06240307 X6.Daule 140.5 2024-03-07 05:30 - 17:30 -80.49874 -2.369768 25 12.0 X6._05240307 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
