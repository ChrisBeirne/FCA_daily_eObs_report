This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 0.0 2023-10-19 05:30 - 14:00 -80.44085 -1.643606 20 8.5 X2._05231019 X2.Quil 21.0 2023-10-18 13:00 - 17:00 -80.44152 -1.643991 9 4.0 X2._13231018 X1.Guayas 24.0 2023-10-18 12:30 - 14:00 -80.19069 -2.009094 4 1.5 X1._12231018 X3.Pigio 21.5 2023-10-18 11:30 - 16:30 -80.56957 -1.586236 11 5.0 X3._11231018 X3.Pigio 27.0 2023-10-18 06:20 - 11:00 -80.56978 -1.585265 15 4.7 X3._06231018 X2.Quil 29.0 2023-10-18 05:30 - 09:00 -80.53635 -1.926193 6 3.5 X2._05231018 X2.Quil 45.0 2023-10-17 14:40 - 17:00 -80.53659 -1.926071 7 2.3 X2._14231017 X1.Guayas 45.0 2023-10-17 13:00 - 17:00 -80.20180 -1.995786 9 4.0 X1._13231017 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-10-17 11:30 - 17:00 -80.56969 -1.584896 14 5.5 X3._11231017 X2.Quil 47.5 2023-10-17 11:00 - 14:30 -80.54630 -1.912693 10 3.5 X2._11231017 X1.Guayas 53.0 2023-10-17 07:30 - 09:00 -80.25622 -2.011096 6 1.5 X1._07231017 X2.Quil 52.5 2023-10-17 05:30 - 09:30 -80.54842 -1.913136 8 4.0 X2._05231017 X1.Guayas 55.0 2023-10-17 05:30 - 07:00 -80.25568 -2.012438 4 1.5 X1._05231017 X3.Pigio 54.5 2023-10-17 05:30 - 07:30 -80.55043 -1.567492 5 2.0 X3._05231017 X1.Guayas 69.0 2023-10-16 15:30 - 17:00 -80.25611 -2.011069 8 1.5 X1._15231016 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-10-16 12:40 - 17:00 -80.55051 -1.567470 11 4.3 X3._12231016 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-10-16 12:00 - 17:00 -80.54826 -1.912966 11 5.0 X2._12231016 X1.Guayas 72.5 2023-10-16 11:00 - 13:30 -80.29043 -2.022447 8 2.5 X1._11231016 X3.Pigio 75.5 2023-10-16 09:00 - 10:30 -80.54077 -1.573068 4 1.5 X3._09231016 X1.Guayas 75.5 2023-10-16 07:00 - 10:30 -80.29500 -2.021819 8 3.5 X1._07231016 X3.Pigio 77.5 2023-10-16 06:30 - 08:30 -80.53997 -1.572487 5 2.0 X3._06231016 X2.Quil 74.5 2023-10-16 06:00 - 11:30 -80.54915 -1.911379 11 5.5 X2._06231016 X3.Pigio 93.0 2023-10-15 15:30 - 17:00 -80.53995 -1.572681 4 1.5 X3._15231015 X1.Guayas 93.0 2023-10-15 11:30 - 17:00 -80.29588 -2.022726 14 5.5 X1._11231015 X1.Guayas 99.0 2023-10-15 09:02 - 11:00 -80.29504 -2.021975 5 2.0 X1._09231015 X3.Pigio 98.0 2023-10-15 09:00 - 12:00 -80.54390 -1.572721 7 3.0 X3._09231015 X2.Quil 93.0 2023-10-15 05:30 - 17:00 -80.54925 -1.911367 27 11.5 X2._05231015 X3.Pigio 102.0 2023-10-15 05:30 - 08:00 -80.53680 -1.569292 6 2.5 X3._05231015 X1.Guayas 101.5 2023-10-15 05:30 - 08:30 -80.29529 -2.023276 7 3.0 X1._05231015 X1.Guayas 117.5 2023-10-14 11:20 - 16:30 -80.29471 -2.021854 17 5.2 X1._11231014 X3.Pigio 123.5 2023-10-14 08:30 - 10:30 -80.54403 -1.572751 5 2.0 X3._08231014 X3.Pigio 126.0 2023-10-14 05:30 - 08:00 -80.56923 -1.566292 6 2.5 X3._05231014 X1.Guayas 126.0 2023-10-14 05:30 - 08:00 -80.25586 -2.012294 6 2.5 X1._05231014 X2.Quil 124.5 2023-10-14 05:30 - 09:30 -80.65369 -1.870564 11 4.0 X2._05231014 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-10-13 15:30 - 17:00 -80.56947 -1.566176 4 1.5 X3._15231013 X3.Pigio 143.0 2023-10-13 13:30 - 15:00 -80.57033 -1.564996 4 1.5 X3._13231013 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-10-13 11:40 - 17:00 -80.25668 -2.011130 14 5.3 X1._11231013 X2.Quil 141.0 2023-10-13 09:00 - 17:00 -80.65378 -1.870089 20 8.0 X2._09231013 X3.Pigio 149.0 2023-10-13 07:30 - 09:00 -80.61871 -1.552365 4 1.5 X3._07231013 X1.Guayas 150.0 2023-10-13 05:30 - 08:00 -80.08635 -2.142526 6 2.5 X1._05231013 X2.Quil 149.5 2023-10-13 05:30 - 08:30 -80.65457 -1.870736 7 3.0 X2._05231013 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
