This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X4.Guasmo 5.5 2023-11-25 05:30 - 08:30 -80.13030 -1.983734 9 3.0 X4._05231125 X4.Guasmo 21.0 2023-11-24 14:50 - 17:00 -80.13039 -1.983653 8 2.2 X4._14231124 X4.Guasmo 25.0 2023-11-24 11:20 - 13:00 -80.11969 -1.997711 5 1.7 X4._11231124 X4.Guasmo 30.0 2023-11-24 05:30 - 08:00 -80.15347 -1.991440 6 2.5 X4._05231124 X4.Guasmo 45.5 2023-11-23 10:30 - 16:30 -80.15234 -1.989477 13 6.0 X4._10231123 X4.Guasmo 52.0 2023-11-23 08:30 - 10:00 -80.15141 -1.989821 4 1.5 X4._08231123 X4.Guasmo 54.0 2023-11-23 05:30 - 08:00 -80.15431 -1.991570 8 2.5 X4._05231123 X3.Pigio 54.0 2023-11-23 05:30 - 08:00 -80.68507 -1.439075 6 2.5 X3._05231123 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-11-22 07:50 - 17:00 -80.68457 -1.438915 29 9.2 X3._07231122 X4.Guasmo 94.5 2023-11-21 14:00 - 15:30 -80.11822 -2.081707 4 1.5 X4._14231121 X4.Guasmo 101.5 2023-11-21 07:00 - 08:30 -80.13059 -1.983757 6 1.5 X4._07231121 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
