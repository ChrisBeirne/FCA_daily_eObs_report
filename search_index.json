This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 13.0 2024-03-27 15:00 - 17:00 -80.08694 -2.145434 5 2.0 X3._15240327 X3.Pigio 21.5 2024-03-27 05:30 - 08:30 -80.37314 -2.357114 7 3.0 X3._05240327 X3.Pigio 36.5 2024-03-26 10:30 - 17:30 -80.37423 -2.357419 16 7.0 X3._10240326 X4.Guasmo 37.0 2024-03-26 06:30 - 17:00 -80.18648 -2.014390 24 10.5 X4._06240326 X3.Pigio 45.5 2024-03-26 05:30 - 08:30 -80.35792 -2.371567 7 3.0 X3._05240326 X4.Guasmo 60.5 2024-03-25 16:00 - 17:30 -80.18891 -2.019385 4 1.5 X4._16240325 X4.Guasmo 62.5 2024-03-25 11:30 - 15:30 -80.18649 -2.014364 9 4.0 X4._11240325 X6.Daule 69.0 2024-03-25 06:00 - 09:00 -80.24077 -2.350595 4 3.0 X6._06240325 X4.Guasmo 71.0 2024-03-25 05:40 - 07:00 -80.33976 -1.980824 5 1.3 X4._05240325 X3.Pigio 69.0 2024-03-25 05:30 - 09:00 -80.31618 -2.345635 8 3.5 X3._05240325 X3.Pigio 84.5 2024-03-24 15:40 - 17:30 -80.31646 -2.346175 6 1.8 X3._15240324 X4.Guasmo 84.5 2024-03-24 14:20 - 17:30 -80.33968 -1.981604 9 3.2 X4._14240324 X6.Daule 85.0 2024-03-24 14:00 - 17:00 -80.24074 -2.350580 4 3.0 X6._14240324 X3.Pigio 87.0 2024-03-24 13:00 - 15:00 -80.37767 -2.383456 5 2.0 X3._13240324 X4.Guasmo 90.0 2024-03-24 10:20 - 12:00 -80.33668 -1.986266 8 1.7 X4._10240324 X3.Pigio 92.5 2024-03-24 07:00 - 09:30 -80.31755 -2.257161 8 2.5 X3._07240324 X6.Daule 93.0 2024-03-24 06:00 - 09:00 -80.42593 -2.319223 4 3.0 X6._06240324 X4.Guasmo 93.5 2024-03-24 05:30 - 08:30 -80.36079 -2.026696 7 3.0 X4._05240324 X2.Quil 108.5 2024-03-23 13:20 - 17:30 -80.48238 -1.519537 10 4.2 X2._13240323 X3.Pigio 108.5 2024-03-23 13:00 - 17:30 -80.31900 -2.258507 10 4.5 X3._13240323 X4.Guasmo 110.5 2024-03-23 13:00 - 15:30 -80.34934 -2.025234 6 2.5 X4._13240323 X6.Daule 109.0 2024-03-23 11:00 - 17:00 -80.42582 -2.319185 7 6.0 X6._11240323 X4.Guasmo 113.5 2024-03-23 11:00 - 12:30 -80.34682 -2.026316 4 1.5 X4._11240323 X3.Pigio 113.5 2024-03-23 11:00 - 12:30 -80.31751 -2.257386 8 1.5 X3._11240323 X1.Guayas 117.5 2024-03-23 07:00 - 08:30 -80.59284 -1.836742 4 1.5 X1._07240323 X2.Quil 116.0 2024-03-23 06:30 - 10:00 -80.49716 -1.489741 10 3.5 X2._06240323 X4.Guasmo 116.0 2024-03-23 06:30 - 10:00 -80.34621 -2.028610 8 3.5 X4._06240323 X3.Pigio 118.0 2024-03-23 06:20 - 08:00 -80.31705 -2.282714 6 1.7 X3._06240323 X6.Daule 117.0 2024-03-23 06:00 - 09:00 -80.42166 -2.314602 4 3.0 X6._06240323 X4.Guasmo 132.5 2024-03-22 16:00 - 17:30 -80.34695 -2.025823 4 1.5 X4._16240322 X2.Quil 132.5 2024-03-22 15:00 - 17:30 -80.49643 -1.488204 6 2.5 X2._15240322 X1.Guayas 132.5 2024-03-22 13:50 - 17:30 -80.59260 -1.836066 10 3.7 X1._13240322 X2.Quil 135.5 2024-03-22 12:00 - 14:30 -80.49706 -1.489639 6 2.5 X2._12240322 X4.Guasmo 138.0 2024-03-22 07:30 - 12:00 -80.34583 -2.027833 10 4.5 X4._07240322 X6.Daule 133.0 2024-03-22 06:00 - 17:00 -80.42085 -2.314397 12 11.0 X6._06240322 X1.Guayas 141.0 2024-03-22 05:30 - 09:00 -80.56205 -1.821157 8 3.5 X1._05240322 X2.Quil 140.0 2024-03-22 05:30 - 10:00 -80.49370 -1.487675 10 4.5 X2._05240322 X4.Guasmo 143.0 2024-03-22 05:30 - 07:00 -80.34430 -2.028480 4 1.5 X4._05240322 X2.Quil 156.5 2024-03-21 14:30 - 17:30 -80.49416 -1.487820 7 3.0 X2._14240321 X3.Pigio 156.5 2024-03-21 13:40 - 17:30 -80.32092 -2.274625 10 3.8 X3._13240321 X4.Guasmo 158.0 2024-03-21 12:40 - 16:00 -80.34613 -2.027641 10 3.3 X4._12240321 X6.Daule 157.0 2024-03-21 12:00 - 17:00 -80.42087 -2.314877 6 5.0 X6._12240321 X2.Quil 160.5 2024-03-21 11:30 - 13:30 -80.49752 -1.485960 5 2.0 X2._11240321 X1.Guayas 158.0 2024-03-21 10:00 - 16:00 -80.56270 -1.821873 15 6.0 X1._10240321 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
