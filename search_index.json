This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 2.0 2023-10-15 09:00 - 12:00 -80.54390 -1.572721 7 3.0 X3._09231015 X3.Pigio 6.0 2023-10-15 05:30 - 08:00 -80.53680 -1.569292 6 2.5 X3._05231015 X3.Pigio 27.5 2023-10-14 08:30 - 10:30 -80.54403 -1.572751 5 2.0 X3._08231014 X3.Pigio 30.0 2023-10-14 05:30 - 08:00 -80.56923 -1.566292 6 2.5 X3._05231014 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-10-13 15:30 - 17:00 -80.56947 -1.566176 4 1.5 X3._15231013 X3.Pigio 47.0 2023-10-13 13:30 - 15:00 -80.57033 -1.564996 4 1.5 X3._13231013 X2.Quil 48.0 2023-10-13 09:00 - 14:00 -80.65354 -1.870179 14 5.0 X2._09231013 X3.Pigio 53.0 2023-10-13 07:30 - 09:00 -80.61871 -1.552365 4 1.5 X3._07231013 X2.Quil 53.5 2023-10-13 05:30 - 08:30 -80.65457 -1.870736 7 3.0 X2._05231013 X3.Pigio 70.0 2023-10-12 13:50 - 16:00 -80.62723 -1.550586 6 2.2 X3._13231012 X1.Guayas 72.0 2023-10-12 11:30 - 14:00 -80.08817 -2.143733 6 2.5 X1._11231012 X1.Guayas 76.0 2023-10-12 06:30 - 10:00 -80.08653 -2.142611 8 3.5 X1._06231012 X2.Quil 69.0 2023-10-12 05:30 - 17:00 -80.65371 -1.870524 27 11.5 X2._05231012 X3.Pigio 78.5 2023-10-12 05:30 - 07:30 -80.61875 -1.556055 5 2.0 X3._05231012 X2.Quil 93.0 2023-10-11 15:10 - 17:00 -80.65342 -1.870571 11 1.8 X2._15231011 X3.Pigio 93.5 2023-10-11 14:10 - 16:30 -80.61594 -1.553633 7 2.3 X3._14231011 X2.Quil 95.5 2023-10-11 13:00 - 14:30 -80.62628 -1.867395 6 1.5 X2._13231011 X3.Pigio 97.8 2023-10-11 10:50 - 12:10 -80.60213 -1.618433 7 1.3 X3._10231011 X3.Pigio 101.0 2023-10-11 05:30 - 09:00 -80.50973 -1.740442 8 3.5 X3._05231011 X1.Guayas 101.5 2023-10-11 05:30 - 08:30 -80.28082 -2.061603 7 3.0 X1._05231011 X2.Quil 101.0 2023-10-11 05:30 - 09:00 -80.65345 -1.870495 8 3.5 X2._05231011 X3.Pigio 117.0 2023-10-10 15:30 - 17:00 -80.50973 -1.740932 6 1.5 X3._15231010 X1.Guayas 117.0 2023-10-10 15:00 - 17:00 -80.28047 -2.058729 5 2.0 X1._15231010 X2.Quil 117.0 2023-10-10 15:00 - 17:00 -80.65332 -1.870373 9 2.0 X2._15231010 X1.Guayas 120.0 2023-10-10 12:00 - 14:00 -80.28077 -2.058706 7 2.0 X1._12231010 X1.Guayas 123.5 2023-10-10 07:40 - 10:30 -80.42443 -2.022001 7 2.8 X1._07231010 X2.Quil 119.5 2023-10-10 05:30 - 14:30 -80.65511 -1.870949 19 9.0 X2._05231010 X3.Pigio 125.0 2023-10-10 05:30 - 09:00 -80.60254 -1.647992 10 3.5 X3._05231010 X3.Pigio 141.0 2023-10-09 15:40 - 17:00 -80.60236 -1.647852 5 1.3 X3._15231009 X2.Quil 141.0 2023-10-09 15:20 - 17:00 -80.65404 -1.870575 5 1.7 X2._15231009 X3.Pigio 142.5 2023-10-09 13:50 - 15:30 -80.60251 -1.654837 6 1.7 X3._13231009 X1.Guayas 141.5 2023-10-09 08:00 - 16:30 -80.42482 -2.021413 24 8.5 X1._08231009 X2.Quil 148.0 2023-10-09 07:00 - 10:00 -80.41738 -2.092685 7 3.0 X2._07231009 X3.Pigio 148.0 2023-10-09 05:30 - 10:00 -80.62111 -1.624472 10 4.5 X3._05231009 X1.Guayas 150.5 2023-10-09 05:30 - 07:30 -80.42418 -2.022100 5 2.0 X1._05231009 X1.Guayas 165.0 2023-10-08 15:30 - 17:00 -80.42509 -2.021449 4 1.5 X1._15231008 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
