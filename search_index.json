This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X3.Pigio 1.5 2024-03-01 05:30 - 12:30 -80.13801 -2.126219 15 7.0 X3._05240301 X6.Daule 20.5 2024-02-29 15:30 - 17:30 -80.28495 -2.257238 7 2.0 X6._15240229 X3.Pigio 20.5 2024-02-29 14:30 - 17:30 -80.13790 -2.125889 7 3.0 X3._14240229 X3.Pigio 29.0 2024-02-29 06:00 - 09:00 -80.60306 -2.343721 7 3.0 X3._06240229 X6.Daule 28.0 2024-02-29 06:00 - 10:00 -80.52825 -2.131396 9 4.0 X6._06240229 X3.Pigio 44.5 2024-02-28 14:30 - 17:30 -80.60234 -2.343357 7 3.0 X3._14240228 X6.Daule 44.5 2024-02-28 14:20 - 17:30 -80.52820 -2.131097 9 3.2 X6._14240228 X6.Daule 48.0 2024-02-28 09:30 - 14:00 -80.54941 -2.120780 10 4.5 X6._09240228 X3.Pigio 54.0 2024-02-28 06:00 - 08:00 -80.63334 -1.913796 5 2.0 X3._06240228 X6.Daule 53.5 2024-02-28 06:00 - 08:30 -80.54702 -2.119363 6 2.5 X6._06240228 X3.Pigio 68.5 2024-02-27 14:30 - 17:30 -80.63316 -1.913476 7 3.0 X3._14240227 X3.Pigio 76.5 2024-02-27 06:30 - 09:30 -80.80461 -1.648860 7 3.0 X3._06240227 X6.Daule 68.5 2024-02-27 06:00 - 17:30 -80.54716 -2.119545 26 11.5 X6._06240227 X6.Daule 93.5 2024-02-26 14:30 - 16:30 -80.54828 -2.117129 7 2.0 X6._14240226 X3.Pigio 93.5 2024-02-26 14:00 - 16:30 -80.80693 -1.647070 6 2.5 X3._14240226 X6.Daule 96.5 2024-02-26 11:10 - 13:30 -80.54957 -2.104592 7 2.3 X6._11240226 X3.Pigio 100.5 2024-02-26 06:00 - 09:30 -80.80350 -1.638905 8 3.5 X3._06240226 X6.Daule 101.5 2024-02-26 06:00 - 08:30 -80.49699 -2.077846 6 2.5 X6._06240226 X3.Pigio 116.5 2024-02-25 15:00 - 17:30 -80.80331 -1.638745 6 2.5 X3._15240225 X3.Pigio 119.2 2024-02-25 12:30 - 14:50 -80.80385 -1.640311 7 2.3 X3._12240225 X4.Guasmo 119.5 2024-02-25 12:00 - 14:30 -80.25466 -2.009713 6 2.5 X4._12240225 X4.Guasmo 124.0 2024-02-25 08:20 - 10:00 -80.26515 -2.008984 6 1.7 X4._08240225 X3.Pigio 125.0 2024-02-25 06:00 - 09:00 -80.77118 -1.641164 7 3.0 X3._06240225 X6.Daule 123.5 2024-02-25 06:00 - 10:30 -80.45415 -2.076392 10 4.5 X6._06240225 X4.Guasmo 126.5 2024-02-25 06:00 - 07:30 -80.26637 -2.011521 4 1.5 X4._06240225 X6.Daule 140.5 2024-02-24 16:10 - 17:30 -80.45413 -2.076629 6 1.3 X6._16240224 X3.Pigio 140.5 2024-02-24 12:20 - 17:30 -80.77108 -1.640579 14 5.2 X3._12240224 X3.Pigio 148.5 2024-02-24 06:00 - 09:30 -80.79734 -1.675310 8 3.5 X3._06240224 X4.Guasmo 148.0 2024-02-24 06:00 - 10:01 -80.25451 -2.009553 11 4.0 X4._06240224 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
