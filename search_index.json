This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X1.Guayas 16.0 2023-10-12 11:30 - 14:00 -80.08817 -2.143733 6 2.5 X1._11231012 X1.Guayas 20.0 2023-10-12 06:30 - 10:00 -80.08653 -2.142611 8 3.5 X1._06231012 X2.Quil 13.0 2023-10-12 05:30 - 17:00 -80.65371 -1.870524 27 11.5 X2._05231012 X2.Quil 37.0 2023-10-11 15:10 - 17:00 -80.65342 -1.870571 11 1.8 X2._15231011 X2.Quil 39.5 2023-10-11 13:00 - 14:30 -80.62628 -1.867395 6 1.5 X2._13231011 X3.Pigio 41.8 2023-10-11 10:50 - 12:10 -80.60213 -1.618433 7 1.3 X3._10231011 X3.Pigio 45.0 2023-10-11 05:30 - 09:00 -80.50973 -1.740442 8 3.5 X3._05231011 X1.Guayas 45.5 2023-10-11 05:30 - 08:30 -80.28082 -2.061603 7 3.0 X1._05231011 X2.Quil 45.0 2023-10-11 05:30 - 09:00 -80.65345 -1.870495 8 3.5 X2._05231011 X3.Pigio 61.0 2023-10-10 15:30 - 17:00 -80.50973 -1.740932 6 1.5 X3._15231010 X1.Guayas 61.0 2023-10-10 15:00 - 17:00 -80.28047 -2.058729 5 2.0 X1._15231010 X2.Quil 61.0 2023-10-10 15:00 - 17:00 -80.65332 -1.870373 9 2.0 X2._15231010 X1.Guayas 64.0 2023-10-10 12:00 - 14:00 -80.28077 -2.058706 7 2.0 X1._12231010 X1.Guayas 67.5 2023-10-10 07:40 - 10:30 -80.42443 -2.022001 7 2.8 X1._07231010 X2.Quil 63.5 2023-10-10 05:30 - 14:30 -80.65511 -1.870949 19 9.0 X2._05231010 X3.Pigio 69.0 2023-10-10 05:30 - 09:00 -80.60254 -1.647992 10 3.5 X3._05231010 X3.Pigio 85.0 2023-10-09 15:40 - 17:00 -80.60236 -1.647852 5 1.3 X3._15231009 X2.Quil 85.0 2023-10-09 15:20 - 17:00 -80.65404 -1.870575 5 1.7 X2._15231009 X3.Pigio 86.5 2023-10-09 13:50 - 15:30 -80.60251 -1.654837 6 1.7 X3._13231009 X1.Guayas 85.5 2023-10-09 08:00 - 16:30 -80.42482 -2.021413 24 8.5 X1._08231009 X2.Quil 92.0 2023-10-09 07:00 - 10:00 -80.41738 -2.092685 7 3.0 X2._07231009 X3.Pigio 92.0 2023-10-09 05:30 - 10:00 -80.62111 -1.624472 10 4.5 X3._05231009 X1.Guayas 94.5 2023-10-09 05:30 - 07:30 -80.42418 -2.022100 5 2.0 X1._05231009 X3.Pigio 109.5 2023-10-08 14:00 - 16:30 -80.62028 -1.623666 6 2.5 X3._14231008 X1.Guayas 109.0 2023-10-08 12:50 - 17:00 -80.42509 -2.021449 13 4.2 X1._12231008 X1.Guayas 117.0 2023-10-08 07:30 - 09:00 -80.07123 -2.163739 4 1.5 X1._07231008 X3.Pigio 115.5 2023-10-08 05:30 - 10:30 -80.56273 -1.584819 11 5.0 X3._05231008 X2.Quil 117.8 2023-10-08 05:30 - 08:10 -80.42484 -1.902379 9 2.7 X2._05231008 X1.Guayas 119.0 2023-10-08 05:30 - 07:00 -80.07234 -2.151941 6 1.5 X1._05231008 X1.Guayas 133.0 2023-10-07 15:10 - 17:00 -80.07247 -2.151575 5 1.8 X1._15231007 X1.Guayas 135.5 2023-10-07 12:30 - 14:30 -80.08184 -2.147275 7 2.0 X1._12231007 X3.Pigio 133.0 2023-10-07 11:10 - 17:00 -80.56271 -1.584936 16 5.8 X3._11231007 X2.Quil 140.0 2023-10-07 08:10 - 10:00 -80.78233 -1.668420 6 1.8 X2._08231007 X2.Quil 142.0 2023-10-07 05:30 - 08:00 -80.78170 -1.668272 8 2.5 X2._05231007 X3.Pigio 142.0 2023-10-07 05:30 - 08:00 -80.64125 -1.576849 6 2.5 X3._05231007 X3.Pigio 157.0 2023-10-06 15:30 - 17:00 -80.64119 -1.576830 4 1.5 X3._15231006 X1.Guayas 157.0 2023-10-06 14:50 - 17:00 -80.56612 -1.875698 13 2.2 X1._14231006 X2.Quil 157.0 2023-10-06 13:42 - 17:00 -80.78180 -1.668125 9 3.3 X2._13231006 X3.Pigio 159.0 2023-10-06 13:30 - 15:00 -80.64108 -1.577585 4 1.5 X3._13231006 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night.
