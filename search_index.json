This map should be checked daily to find potential feeding sites for visual confirmation. The field team should: Prioritize recent clusters - we are more likely to find a carcass if a vulture was feeding recently Prioritize accessible clusters - not all of these clusters will be accessible, you should figure out which would be the easiest to visit Prioritize clusters with multiple individuals - if more than one individual has visited a cluster, this could suggest a large feeding event Key: Colored circles denote clusters of &gt; than 1 hour duration, where the vultures have low distances travelled The colors denote how recently the cluster started (Red &gt;24 hours; orange 24-48 hours; blue 48+ hours) Hover over the circle for gps coordinates, cluster radius, number of points in the cluster and duration of the event The following is a list of all of the clusters in the above map, ordered by age (newest first): name cluster_age_h date timeRange long lat npos duration code X2.Quil 6.5 2023-10-26 05:30 - 07:30 -80.09853 -2.133316 5 2.0 X2._05231026 X2.Quil 21.0 2023-10-25 15:30 - 17:00 -80.09831 -2.133214 4 1.5 X2._15231025 X2.Quil 23.0 2023-10-25 12:20 - 15:00 -80.09011 -2.133927 8 2.7 X2._12231025 X1.Guayas 29.0 2023-10-25 05:00 - 09:00 -80.08411 -2.146073 5 4.0 X1._05231025 X2.Quil 30.5 2023-10-25 05:00 - 07:30 -79.99395 -2.166818 8 2.5 X2._05231025 X1.Guayas 45.0 2023-10-24 14:00 - 17:00 -80.08353 -2.145954 5 3.0 X1._14231024 X2.Quil 45.0 2023-10-24 13:10 - 17:01 -79.99351 -2.166844 12 3.9 X2._13231024 X2.Quil 52.0 2023-10-24 05:30 - 10:00 -80.07891 -2.134371 10 4.5 X2._05231024 X1.Guayas 78.0 2023-10-23 06:00 - 08:00 -80.54902 -1.913493 3 2.0 X1._06231023 X2.Quil 93.5 2023-10-22 14:30 - 16:30 -80.50984 -1.628305 5 2.0 X2._14231022 X1.Guayas 93.0 2023-10-22 14:00 - 17:00 -80.54957 -1.913217 5 3.0 X1._14231022 X2.Quil 96.0 2023-10-22 12:20 - 14:00 -80.51008 -1.631778 7 1.7 X2._12231022 X1.Guayas 96.5 2023-10-22 09:00 - 13:30 -80.54889 -1.912536 10 4.5 X1._09231022 X2.Quil 100.0 2023-10-22 08:00 - 10:00 -80.44063 -1.643307 5 2.0 X2._08231022 X1.Guayas 101.5 2023-10-22 05:30 - 08:30 -80.54865 -1.913630 7 3.0 X1._05231022 X2.Quil 102.5 2023-10-22 05:30 - 07:30 -80.44174 -1.643230 5 2.0 X2._05231022 X2.Quil 117.5 2023-10-21 12:00 - 16:30 -80.43824 -1.641734 12 4.5 X2._12231021 X4.Guasmo 118.5 2023-10-21 11:00 - 15:30 -80.09488 -2.017162 10 4.5 X4._11231021 X2.Quil 122.5 2023-10-21 09:00 - 11:30 -80.44112 -1.643020 8 2.5 X2._09231021 X4.Guasmo 123.5 2023-10-21 07:00 - 10:30 -80.09634 -2.016957 10 3.5 X4._07231021 X1.Guayas 117.5 2023-10-21 05:30 - 16:30 -80.54874 -1.913699 23 11.0 X1._05231021 X2.Quil 125.2 2023-10-21 05:30 - 08:50 -80.44051 -1.643536 9 3.3 X2._05231021 X1.Guayas 141.0 2023-10-20 13:51 - 17:00 -80.54839 -1.913886 9 3.1 X1._13231020 X4.Guasmo 142.0 2023-10-20 06:30 - 16:00 -80.09163 -2.014808 20 9.5 X4._06231020 X2.Quil 141.0 2023-10-20 05:30 - 17:00 -80.44093 -1.643570 30 11.5 X2._05231020 X3.Pigio 149.5 2023-10-20 05:30 - 08:30 -80.56963 -1.584222 7 3.0 X3._05231020 "],["roost-and-nest-sites.html", "Part 4 Roost and nest sites", " Part 4 Roost and nest sites The following map shows the locations where birds spend the night for the last two weeks.
